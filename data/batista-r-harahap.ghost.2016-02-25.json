Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. Go ahead and edit this post to get going and learn how it all works!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWriting in markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *formatting* shortcuts to style your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](http://tryghost.org/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","html":"<p>You're in! Nice.

This is why I paid Google a little visit to translate a phrase, so here it goes <em><strong>\"Privet, Rossiya\"</strong></em>.\n<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/from.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-159\" title=\"Russia\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/from.jpg\" alt=\"Russia\" width=\"353\" height=\"95\" /></a></li>  \n    <li>Now this is the most interesting fact that got my attention right away. At least 91% of the total visit was a direct visit which means most of the visitors typed in Bango29.com into their browser's address bar. I'm flattered :) Hope this trend will keep continuing.\n<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/where.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"Where\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/where.jpg\" alt=\"Where\" width=\"351\" height=\"25\" /></a></li>  \n</ol>  \n\n<p>So eventually I'm currently reworking Bango29.com and adding in some Twitter elements. I've come to love Twitter by the way. It feels great to share information and knowledge to others. I mean this. In the following weeks I will be experimenting with different approaches and my apologies if some of the experiments will have a bad effect for your eyes.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I wanna give a big warm welcome to everyone and hopefully you all will enjoy this blog as much as I do.

For the last year I've been focusing my efforts to study about the techniques involved.\r\n\r\nThe worst part of the hobby is the pricing. Everything is NOT reasonably priced! This kind of photography is considered niche for tripod head makers and they overprice their products to the point where it is becoming a significant barrier for amateurs. Because of the high price tag, products are never a ready stock here in Indonesia. We have to wait as long as 6 months for distributors to re-stock their inventories.\r\n\r\nI just hope that I'm doing something about the barriers above by writing it here on my blog.\r\n\r\nWell I didn't give up at all! I scoured the Internet to look for DIY tripod heads. Googled it and a bunch of designs showed up. All of them from professional photographers around the world. It took me quite a while to figure out photography jargons. For jargons related with panoramic photography, here are a few and its meaning:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Parallax Effect\r\nThis is the most important part of the photography itself. There's no easy way to explain this but to try will be like seeing things with only 1 perspective. Try closing your left eye and now open it and close your right eye. You will see that the objects in front of is not in the same position with each eye perspective. This must be avoided at all cost with panoramic photography or you will get stitching errors.</li>\r\n\t<li>Nodal Point\r\nThe nodal point is the center of the lens to be short. If you find your lens' nodal point and place it on a panoramic tripod head, no matter where you move your camera, the perspective will always be the same. For more technical explanation about Parallax Effect &amp; Nodal Point, you can take a look at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0HaRZi-FWs\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0HaRZi-FWs</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>Zenith &amp; Nadir\r\nThe Zenith is the picture frame on top while Nadir is the picture frame below.</li>\r\n\t<li>Software Stitcher\r\nNow to get all the pictures into a 3D projection, you will need stitching software. I personally use <a href=\"http://www.autopano.net\">Autopano Giga</a>. This is the most comfortable compared with all others for me. Other software you can use are <a href=\"http://hugin.sourceforge.net\" target=\"_blank\">Hugin</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.ptgui.com\" target=\"_blank\">PTGui Pro</a>. I create spherical panoramas because it's less hassle to do.</li>\r\n\t<li>Flash Panoramic Viewer\r\nHere comes the champion. I am a proud <a href=\"http://www.krpano.com\" target=\"_self\">KRPANO</a> user. It's very easy to learn and very flexible to extend. They use an XML config file that is very intuitive and documentation is brilliant.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAnyways, I'm not planning to detail much of the process here, but if you find this interesting, tweet me <a href=\"http://twitter.com/tista\" target=\"_self\">@tista</a> and I'll reconsider.\r\n\r\nHere are some of my shots with a rather imperfect DIY tripod head. Click on the images and it will take to the panoramic view. The panoramic view file is well over 4 MB so it'll be quite a while to show up.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_166\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"353\" caption=\"Taman Mini Indonesia Indah - Tugu Api Pancasila\"]<a href=\"http://mediafusion.web.id/panorama/tmii/tmii.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-166  \" title=\"Taman Mini Indonesia Indah - Tugu Api Pancasila\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tmii1.jpg\" alt=\"Taman Mini Indonesia Indah - Tugu Api Pancasila\" width=\"353\" height=\"176\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_167\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"353\" caption=\"Living Room\"]<a href=\"http://bango29.com/pano/pano3.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-167  \" title=\"Living Room\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/rumah1.jpg\" alt=\"Living Room\" width=\"353\" height=\"176\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nI still have 1 other panoramic view of <a href=\"http://www.tamanmini.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rumah Gadang, Sumatera Barat - Taman Mini Indonesia Indah</a> but it still being processed as I type so I'm gonna post those 2 first.\r\n\r\nYou can notice on the panoramic view that straight lines are sometimes broken.

This makes the search for a solution become slow. I really prefer the old support forum but I guess this is what we get for free. It's good enough but I hope the developers will make their own support forum for others so that information will be in the open not dependent with their website only.

It's good enough but I hope the developers will make their own support forum for others so that information will be in the open not dependent with their website only. I will host it on my server if anyone wants to start one :)</li>  \n    <li>Adobe Flash Pro CS5 &amp; Adobe AIR 2.0 - <a href=\"http://cs5launch.adobe.com\" target=\"_blank\">cs5launch.adobe.com</a>\n[youtube _hkfOk8P79s]I can only say as much as the video above say, just with an added note: WONDERFUL ADOBE! Now we can make games specifically, with only Flash &amp; AIR. Let's see how this goes. April 12th 2010 is the launch date. Stay tuned!</li>\n</ol>  \n\n<p>To wrap things up, I'm very glad the way the web has made an impact in the application development scene. It has certainly bring a whole new level of possibilities for web developers. Not only now we're adept in our own world, we can be as skilled in other parts of the programming world. So I guess a Thank You is owed to the Open Source developers of the first 2 projects, you guys rock! For Adobe, well you have to come up with something, HTML5 is taking over lol.  </p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1387126097834,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1387126097834,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1270493545000,"published_by":1},{"id":39,"uuid":"8f66538d-ac00-428a-80ce-1032afac2737","title":"Mobile Augmented Reality, A Basic Tutorial - Part 1","slug":"mobile-augmented-reality-a-basic-tutorial-part-1","markdown":"On my last post, I mentioned the definition of Augmented Reality (AR). Now I'm adding the word Mobile to it.\r\n\r\nAt the current time, platforms that I've tried to developed upon supporting AR are iPhone and Android. Well actually I coded once and used <a href=\"http://www.appcelerator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Titanium Developer</a> to make the actual executable files for each platform.\r\n\r\nTitanium offers current web standards as a mean to create those mobile applications. I'm now using Titanium Developer 1.0 with the 1.1 Mobile SDK. The requirements to be able to run Titanium and produce for iPhone &amp; Android are:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A decent Mac running Snow Leopard (Leopard will do). I used my Macbook and a Hackintosh hehe.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html\" target=\"_blank\">Xcode</a>. Get it from your installation cd that comes with your Mac.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone SDK</a> 3.0 minimal.

It will start on the Dashboard module. Go ahead and click on the NEW PROJECT top left icon.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_205\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"297\" caption=\"Step 1 - New Project\"]<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-205\" title=\"Step 1 - New Project\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step1.jpg\" alt=\"Step 1 - New Project\" width=\"297\" height=\"74\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNext up, it will show a screen showing metadata and configurations for the application. Choose <em><strong>Mobile</strong></em> as the project type. Type in the application name on the name column; I'm naming it <em><strong>Mobile AR Demo</strong></em>. Identify our application and in this case, it's <em><strong>com.mf.ardemo</strong></em>. Choose the directory where our application will reside and enter a URL for it. I'm using Titanium 1.1 so I choose <em><strong>1.1.0</strong></em> as the Titanium SDK Version. Now if Titanium successfully found your iPhone and Android SDK path, it will show a check mark on both, if not, you will have to specify the path. Click on <strong>Create Project</strong> afterwards and it will show another screen displaying editable fields.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_208\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"412\" caption=\"Step 2 - Project Metadata &amp; Configuration 1\"]<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-208 \" title=\"Project Metadata &amp; Configuration\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step2.jpg\" alt=\"Project Metadata &amp; Configuration\" width=\"412\" height=\"269\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_211\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"407\" caption=\"Step 3 - Project Metadata &amp; Configuration 2\"]<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-211 \" title=\"Project Metadata &amp; Configuration 2\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step3.jpg\" alt=\"Project Metadata &amp; Configuration 2\" width=\"407\" height=\"308\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe most important part on Step 3 will be specifying your <strong>Application Icon</strong>. Use any 57x57 pixels icon of your choosing. It will default to Titanium's icon if not specified.\r\n\r\nNext up, you may wanna change the default splash screen when the application is launched. To do this, go to the directory where your application resides. In my case it will be <strong>/Users/Tista/Development/iPhone/Mobile AR Demo</strong>. When you're in there, go to the <strong>Resources </strong>sub folder. That is where we're gonna put all our JavaScript files along with all other resources. Inside the directory, you will find an <strong>android</strong> and an <strong>iphone </strong>directory. Make a 320x480 pixels splash screen and you're set. Put your splash screen there replacing the <strong>Default.png</strong> file. What's interesting is that you can specify different Application Icons and Splash Screens for both platforms, just put them in the respective directories and Titanium will automatically configure.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_213\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"386\" caption=\"Step 4 - Application Icon &amp; Splash Screen\"]<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-213 \" title=\"Step 4 - Application Icon &amp; Splash Screen\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step4.jpg\" alt=\"Step 4 - Application Icon &amp; Splash Screen\" width=\"386\" height=\"90\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe 4 steps we did earlier is already enough to show a Hello World application on your device. If you wanna test it, you can go ahead and use the emulators. Back in Titanium, click on the <strong>Test &amp; Package</strong> tab. I will try running on an iPhone emulator, it's chosen by default so I go ahead and choose the SDK I'm aiming for which is <strong>3.1.2</strong> and just click <em><strong>Launch</strong>. </em>Afterward Titanium will show verbose output of what it's currently doing on the blank window. Upon success, it will immediately launch the application on the emulator.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_214\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"350\" caption=\"Step 5 - Run on Emulator 1\"]<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-214  \" title=\"Step 5 - Run on Emulator\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step5.jpg\" alt=\"Step 5 - Run on Emulator\" width=\"350\" height=\"270\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_215\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"375\" caption=\"Step 5 - Run on Emulator 2\"]<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step5.2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-215   \" title=\"Step 5 - Run on Emulator 2\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/step5.2.jpg\" alt=\"Step 5 - Run on Emulator 2\" width=\"375\" height=\"182\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nOK so the 5 steps above wraps up Part 1 of the tutorial.

He was one of the engineers who were responsible for a great Yahoo OHD 2009 Internet connection. He sensibly told me that it was indeed a flaw in their recent policy change and that all MetroNET 1 Mbps accounts are experiencing the same thing. He said there will be a policy change yet again this Saturday so I'm gonna keep my fingers crossed. Thanks Biznet.</strong>\r\n\r\nOkay, it's been a while since I first subscribed to Biznet at my office. In Kemang Point, there's practically only 2 ISPs providing Internet access which are Biznet and Telkom Speedy.\r\n\r\nI had a very bad experience with Telkom Speedy. In the day time, I can't even connect and if when I did managed to connect, it's still not as I've come to expect. Very slow and very problematic.\r\n\r\nSo I opted for Biznet as the office's ISP. I started subscribing around November 2009. The first time I subscribed to MetroNET 1 Mbps was wonderful. Everything was as I expected. I even upgraded the connection speed to 4Mbps for 3 days following urgent needs. Because of my satisfactory level was high, I recommended Biznet as one of 2 ISPs contracted to provide Internet access to Yahoo South East Asia Open Hack Day 2009 event. There were some oops moments with Biznet before the event started but their incredible support team prevailed and make all the woes go away.\r\n\r\nI remembered it was a Saturday and I was at the office configuring a bunch of wireless routers for DD-WRT and 4 PCs to be set up as servers. The Internet connection suddenly dropped. I had no connection whatsoever. I really needed the Internet connection to download Linux &amp; FreeBSD distros. I wanted to try them out to the servers. I called it in to their customer care and waited for hours and still no Internet. At around 10PM, the support team came to my office. They tried to figure out what's been happening with the connection. From their conversation, I can assume the sudden drop was because of a glitch made by one of their engineer. The glitch knocked down the whole Kemang area. I was still satisfied with all the efforts the support team had to extend on a Saturday night :)\r\n\r\nJust a few months ago, another connection drop happened. So again I contacted Biznet's customer care and doing the usual troubleshooting. The problem was on their end. I didn't care actually what the problem is and I paid full every month so I want to be online. They gave a temporary account and it was a 4Mbps. I also got a public static IP with the account. How great was that? I even assigned a subdomain and made my office Hackintosh as a web server. It's for work related reasons mind you ;) lol\r\n\r\nSadly, all things must come to an end. Another connection drop happened. This was because Biznet has fixed the problems and normalizing my connection to the primary account. I received an email saying that all MetroNET 1Mbps subscribers will be assigned a dynamic local IP address. That's nothing new from a NAT point of view and I didn't even consider any problems from it. Well unfortunately for me, it became a problem.\r\n\r\nI noticed that I was failing all the time to login to my WHMCS admin module. I thought it was because the version I'm running is not current. I upgraded WHMCS and the same thing is still happening. I'm also having difficulties logging in into my Cpanel/WHM server. It keeps asking me for passwords. My Cpanel/WHM is the latest STABLE version. I guerrilla my way into Google to find a solution only to find I'm lonely with this phenomena. So I dived into raw logs on the server. I noticed that the connections from my end was from 2 IPs. That's a BIG road block for Cpanel/WHM servers. I'm sure it's security related and I'm not happy disabling security features only to let me login without a hitch.\r\n\r\nSquid is the answer. I tried logging in by using a Squid server. It worked on Cpanel/WHM but failed with WHMCS. I called it in to Biznet Customer Care. They asked me if they can use my account at their end to reproduce the problem. I gave the a demo account login on my Cpanel/WHM server to try for themselves. They said they're experiencing the same old thing. A couple days after, they told me that they've resolved the issue. When I got to the office, THEY DIDN'T! I was still having the same difficulties because the IPs kept alternating and both Cpanel/WHM and WHMCS couldn't be logged in. They called me and I said it was still happening. They wanted to use my account again (leaving me with no Internet on a working day). I refused and they said they'll try their best.\r\n\r\nIt's been a month or so and still I'm having the same problem. Still no appropriate action. I'm very disappointed with them. Their change of policy with the alternating IPs is something that I'm sure well considered by them because I believe Biznet has a great corporate culture to which every ISP in Indonesia must follow. However, as you can see above, my tolerance for dropped connections and the login issue is just at its max.\r\n\r\nIf you're having the same problem I'm having, tell me! Why not start a petition so Biznet will see that it's affecting more subscribers than just me?\r\n\r\nAnyways, I'm still within a moderate satisfactory level with their service and I hope they will deliver better services in the future.

Well here's why it's a hoax:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>This is the most important reason: <strong>YOU PAID FOR YOUR BLACKBERRY SERVICE!</strong> Indonesians are lucky our BB Service plan is unlimited data plan for a fixed rate. Elsewhere in the world, people are capped by the Megabytes of data they send and receive. Imagine pissed customers being tagged inactive and robbed off of their PAID services including with their BBM contacts, lawsuits will follow at least to your respective Operators if not directly to RIM.</li>\r\n\t<li>I'm an IT guy and I do work for the masses of people that will benefit my services.

Well here's why it's a hoax:  </p>\n\n<ol>  \n    <li>This is the most important reason: <strong>YOU PAID FOR YOUR BLACKBERRY SERVICE!</strong> Indonesians are lucky our BB Service plan is unlimited data plan for a fixed rate.

The most notable difference is when you realize that in your Home screen, you won't find the Lock icon. This is annoying.

When It's about to install, it said that the application with the same version is already installed and asked me if I want to replace the pre-installed application.

It's Open Source and have put enough knowledge in my head to make my own app. I wanna share the knowledge I got from Mixare. This is my contribution.\r\n\r\nBefore starting, please make sure you have all the requirements of a regular Android development environment. I'm using Eclipse Galileo with Android SDK Tools Revision 5. My target build is for Android 2.1 API Level 7.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is still basic, it's basically an introduction to Mixare without changing much of its base code. Sufficiently changing what's needed just enough to show our own POI's.\r\n\r\nFirst of, you will need to download the source code from Mixare's website at <a href=\"http://www.mixare.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.mixare.org</a>. The download is available at Google Code.\r\n\r\nOnce you've download the source code, import them into your Eclipse by clicking <strong>File -&gt; Import</strong> from the menu. In my Macbook, there were no problems importing the project but in my Hackintosh, I can't get it to compile. I haven't figure out why yet.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_278\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"356\" caption=\"Import Mixare - Step 1\"]<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-26-at-11.50.51-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-278 \" title=\"Import Mixare - Step 1\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-26-at-11.50.51-PM.png\" alt=\"Import Mixare - Step 1\" width=\"356\" height=\"305\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_279\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"359\" caption=\"Import Mixare - Step 2\"]<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-26-at-11.52.03-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-279 \" title=\"Import Mixare - Step 2\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-26-at-11.52.03-PM.png\" alt=\"Import Mixare - Step 2\" width=\"359\" height=\"391\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter importing the project, to be on the safe side, Clean your Mixare project first by <strong>Project -&gt; Clean</strong> from the menu. Select Mixare from the following window.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_280\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"331\" caption=\"Clean The Project\"]<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-26-at-11.57.27-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-280 \" title=\"Clean The Project\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-26-at-11.57.27-PM.png\" alt=\"Clean The Project\" width=\"331\" height=\"219\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNow let's get down to business. The only you need to change is the DataView.java file from the <strong>src/org/org.mixare</strong> tree. Guess what, you'll only need to change one line :)\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"java\">/** default URL */\r\nString HOME_URL = \"http://bango29.com/mix.php\";</pre>\r\n\r\nI've changed it to a web server which is my blog with the request file <strong>mix.php</strong>. The default was using a Wikipedia server. Again, this is a very basic tutorial. My mix.php file source is as follows.\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"php\" line=\"1\">\r\n<?php\r\necho '{\r\n\t\t\"status\": \"OK\",\r\n\t\t\"num_results\": 3,\r\n\t\t\"results\": [\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"212\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"lat\": \"-6.225062\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"lng\": \"106.790636\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"elevation\": \"0\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"Guess PIM2\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"distance\": \"1.24\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"has_detail_page\": \"1\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"webpage\": \"http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediafusion.web.id\"\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"213\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"lat\": \"-6.179467592090026\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"lng\": \"106.79054260253906\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"elevation\": \"0\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"iBox Plaza EX\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"distance\": \"10.24\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"has_detail_page\": \"1\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"webpage\": \"http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediafusion.web.id\"\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"215\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"lat\": \"-6.175030310631483\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"lng\": \"106.79054260253906\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"elevation\": \"0\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"Red Mango GI\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"distance\": \"9.24\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"has_detail_page\": \"1\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"webpage\": \"http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediafusion.web.id\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t  }';\r\n?>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nAs you can see, my mix.php is only generating static content. It's a JSON encoded array. The PHP file does not care any GET variables it gets, it's only statically serving the 3 POI's above. You can see more documentation about the format of the JSON array <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/mixare/wiki/DisplayYourOwnData\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nNow plug in your Android phone to your USB port, build and run the project. The final outcome is shown above with the video.\r\n\r\nMy next step will be changing that red circle for the POI's into custom icons. You can do this by editing the file <strong>Marker.java</strong> at <strong>src/org/org.mixare</strong> tree.

The only you need to change is the DataView.java file from the <strong>src/org/org.mixare</strong> tree. Guess what, you'll only need to change one line :)</p>\n\n<pre lang=\"java\">/** default URL */  \nString HOME_URL = \"<a href='http://bango29.com/mix.php'>http://bango29.com/mix.php</a>\";</pre>\n\nI've changed it to a web server which is my blog with the request file <strong>mix.php</strong>. The default was using a Wikipedia server. Again, this is a very basic tutorial. My mix.php file source is as follows.\n\n<pre lang=\"php\" line=\"1\">  \n<?php  \necho '{  \n        \"status\": \"OK\",\n        \"num_results\": 3,\n        \"results\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"212\",\n                \"lat\": \"-6.225062\",\n                \"lng\": \"106.790636\",\n                \"elevation\": \"0\",\n                \"title\": \"Guess PIM2\",\n                \"distance\": \"1.24\",\n                \"has_detail_page\": \"1\",\n                \"webpage\": \"http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediafusion.web.id\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"213\",\n                \"lat\": \"-6.179467592090026\",\n                \"lng\": \"106.79054260253906\",\n                \"elevation\": \"0\",\n                \"title\": \"iBox Plaza EX\",\n                \"distance\": \"10.24\",\n                \"has_detail_page\": \"1\",\n                \"webpage\": \"http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediafusion.web.id\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": \"215\",\n                \"lat\": \"-6.175030310631483\",\n                \"lng\": \"106.79054260253906\",\n                \"elevation\": \"0\",\n                \"title\": \"Red Mango GI\",\n                \"distance\": \"9.24\",\n                \"has_detail_page\": \"1\",\n                \"webpage\": \"http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediafusion.web.id\"\n            }\n        ]\n      }';\n?>\n</pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, my mix.php is only generating static content. It's a JSON encoded array. The PHP file does not care any GET variables it gets, it's only statically serving the 3 POI's above. You can see more documentation about the format of the JSON array <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/mixare/wiki/DisplayYourOwnData\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now plug in your Android phone to your USB port, build and run the project. The final outcome is shown above with the video.</p>\n\n<p>My next step will be changing that red circle for the POI's into custom icons. You can do this by editing the file <strong>Marker.java</strong> at <strong>src/org/org.mixare</strong> tree.

Now as it turns out, something so good couldn't be that good.\r\n\r\nI've been their evangelist because of how satisfied I am with their unlimited internet package. Can you imagine I got 1Mbps with HSDPA coverage. A very good speed remembering the internet speed climate in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nNow I'm deeply disappointed. This past week, today was the second time I wasn't able to get any internet. The first one happened mid-week and calling to 817 resolved the problem almost instantly.\r\n\r\nToday the problem started from around 3 pm and it continued even until now. I'm using the SIM card on my Nexus One and I can see that it's not even registering to the GPRS network.\r\n\r\nOn my first call the agent told me that she will try to refresh the system. So I said ok, what shocked me is that when she said the SIM card is NO LONGER tied to the unlimited internet package.\r\n\r\nI was pissed to be honest. There were no notifications whatsoever and I was cut off just like that. When I bought this package at Indocomtech 2009, they told me that for the first 6 months, I must pay IDR 250.000 per month which are IDR 150.000 for unlimited internet and IDR 100.000 for the modem installment. It was a great deal!\r\n\r\nSo moving on again to today's events. The first time I called after the agent said that the SIM card was no longer registered on the unlimited internet package, I asked her why there were no notifications to me regarding this. She couldn't answer me to a point where I can see where the problem lies. Instead she told me to wait on the line while she figure things out. I waited for a long time until I decided that she was too \"busy\" to handle my complaint.\r\n\r\nSwitching off the handset for 5 mins didn't help like the last time. I called 817 again and this time the agent is MUCH more helpful. She told me the same thing and that she would call me after she figure things out.\r\n\r\nNot long (under 5 minutes) after I hung up, she called me. She confirmed that the SIM card was no longer on the unlimited package and she filed a report about this to be handled by their team. She also said I will get an sms to notify me updates. I asked her how long I must wait untill I can get the internet working again. She politely said that they will do their best. All I can respond was that \"OK looking forward for a reply\".\r\n\r\nWell well well I bet my case turned out like this because of some sleazy marketing staff at Indocomtech \"forgot\" to mention the terms and conditions of this specific package! This is what happened when businesses put money first above service. I was NOT satisfied at all.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the agent also told me that the internet package was already cut off since 5th of May. That leaves me with data connection bills. If they asked me to pay for the connection since 5th of May, I will most passionately refuse! There were no warning nor notifications to me directly!\r\n\r\nWell XL, you've been great but I think it's time for me to move on to bigger and better services, Next stop: Telkomsel Flash.\r\n\r\n<strong>Update 1: Today an SMS from XL warned me that my bill is nearing its credit limit. The current on-the-go bill is now at IDR 440.000 when the credit limit is capped at IDR 550.000. I frantically called 817 to ask about this. For the bill it was that much from 4th May 2010 until today 8th of May 2010. I didn't use the phone that much except for Internet and I asked for the details and the agent couldn't give the information because of some system lockdown. She also told me my unlimited internet package was seen registered at the system from 4th March 2010 when I subscribed as early as November 2009. This is crazy.

So I figure why not share more insights. You are most welcomed to share too by commenting this or other Mixare posts.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I've been focusing my efforts with another yet closed source Augmented Reality viewer in Android. I will post a tutorial soon.\r\n\r\nFrom all the frameworks I got my hands on, I must say Mixare is the simplest and most definitely easier to implement than any other frameworks. I accentuated simple because the app itself is still very simple and in its early stages of development.

Nyatanya sudah ada dan berkembang sampai ke titik dimana aplikasinya relatif lebih mudah untuk dibuat dibanding sebelumnya.</p>\n\n<p>Tampaknya teknologi AR masih belum puas dengan 2 istri dan meminang <em>Location Based Service</em> untuk dijadikan <strong>istri ketiganya</strong>. Terpapar dengan realita bahwa lokasi adalah sesuatu yang terus berubah, AR memperistri <em>Mobile</em> menjadi <strong>istri keempatnya</strong>. Kedua teknologi ini dikawinkan dengan AR dan menghasilkan keturunan yang sama menariknya dengan perkawinan pertama dan kedua AR. Lihatlah melalui 2 video berikut ini:  </p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[flashvideo file=<a href='http://www.bango29.com/ar.flv'>http://www.bango29.com/ar.flv</a> /]</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[flashvideo file=<a href='http://www.bango29.com/mixare.flv'>http://www.bango29.com/mixare.flv</a> /]</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kedua video tersebut merupakan aplikasi untuk Android yang dua-duanya merupakan salah satu keturunan AR yang mulai dewasa. Seperti yang saya ungkapkan sebelumnya, yang anda lihat di 2 video sebelumnya bukanlah sesuatu yang terlalu jauh di masa depan karena saat ini saja AR di Mobile adalah <em>mainan</em> saya :)</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Untuk AR, saya sangat pro poligami karena dari perkawinan-perkawinan AR sebelumnya, AR telah menghasilkan keturunan yang sedikit banyak membuat teknologi-teknologi yang selama ini hanya dapat kita lihat di film-film berbau teknologi seperti Star Trek, Iron Man dsb menjadi nyata dan hidup.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Apresiasi saya sebesar-besarnya pada komunitas Open Source di seluruh dunia yang telah memberikan dan menghasilkan produk-produk AR yang <em>out-of-box</em> dan ber-orientasi masa depan. Artikel saya berikutnya akan membahas salah satu istri AR dan hasil perkawinan AR dengan istri kelimanya :)</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1387126097907,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1387126097907,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1273788456000,"published_by":1},{"id":59,"uuid":"780b7204-ea48-4298-a020-59102345cc76","title":"Setting up #Android with #IndosatM2 Broom","slug":"setting-up-android-with-indosatm2-broom","markdown":"I've had it with XL, my tolerance is over my threshold for patience.

Dengan menggunakan fitur-fitur deteksi lokasi yang terdapat pada hampir semua <em>smartphone</em> saat ini, AR telah berubah menjadi sebuah aplikasi yang memberikan pratayang kepada kita semua tentang masa depan.\r\n\r\nBiasanya khalayak umum mengasosiasikan pendeteksian lokasi dengan <em>GPS</em>. Sayang tidak semua smartphone memiliki <em>GPS</em> sebagai fiturnya. Hal ini pun bukan sebuah masalah. Cukup dengan mendeteksi menara operator yang terasosiasi dengan <em>smartphone</em> anda, lokasi dapat terdeteksi. Memang tidak akan akurat sampai beberapa meter namun dapat diterima. Menurut saya ini adalah solusi paling masuk akal karena dapat digunakan di semua tipe <em>smartphone</em>, cepat dan tidak menghabiskan batere smartphone anda.\r\n\r\nLalu bagaimanakah informasi tentang lokasi anda korelasinya dengan AR? Sebenarnya sangat <em>simple</em>, dengan lokasi telah terdeteksi maka aplikasi dapat mencari tahu ada apa saja di sekitar anda. Disinilah peranan istri kelima AR atau <em>Web</em> menjadi penting. <em>Smartphone</em> anda <em>most likely</em> terhubung dengan Internet, dengan begitu penyedia layanan lokasi semacam <a href=\"http://www.urbanesia.com\" target=\"_blank\">Urbanesia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.koprol.com\" target=\"_blank\">Koprol</a>, <a href=\"http://www.citzel.com\" target=\"_blank\">Citzel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foursquare.com\" target=\"_blank\">Foursquare</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gowalla.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gowalla</a> dan lain-lain dapat dikomunikasikan dengan aplikasi untuk melihat apa saja yang ada di sekitar anda.\r\n\r\nSudah banyak aplikasi di berbagai <em>platform</em> yang dapat berkomunikasi dengan penyedia layanan lokasi dan menampilkannya dalam modus AR kepada anda. Ada 3 <em>mobile platform</em> besar yang dapat dibuatkan aplikasi AR yaitu <em>Android</em>, <em>iPhone</em> dan <em>Symbian</em>. Sangat disayangkan masih belum ada <em>mobile platform</em> lain yang membukakan pintu bagi AR agar dapat dinikmati khayalak umum.\r\n\r\nBerbicara tentang aplikasi, satu per satu akan saya bahas aplikasinya dan <em>mobile platform</em> yang didukung. Yang pertama adalah <em><a href=\"http://www.layar.com\" target=\"_blank\">Layar</a></em>, salah satu early adopter untuk AR dan tersedia di <em>Android</em> awalnya dan sekarang juga di <em>iPhone</em>. Lalu ada <a href=\"http://www.wikitude.org\" target=\"_blank\">Wikitude</a> yang tersedia di ketiga mobile platform <em>Android</em>, <em>iPhone</em> dan <em>Symbian</em>. Dari Indonesia pun juga sudah ada jika anda menggunakan Android, lihat saja <a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/blog/2010/poligamy-ar-now-available-at-android-market\" target=\"_blank\">disini</a>.\r\n\r\nMasih banyak aplikasi-aplikasi lainnya yang menggunakan AR dengan kegunaan yang berbeda-beda pula. Satu aplikasi yang saya yakin dapat anda langsung syukuri kegunaannya adalah <a href=\"http://www.androlib.com/android.application.mkt-com-phyora-augsatnav-qtiC.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><em>AugSatNav</em></a> yang tersedia di Android. Dengan aplikasi ini, anda dapat melihat arah dalam bentuk 3D langsung diproyeksikan di kamera <em>smartphone</em> anda. Bayangkan <em>use case</em> aplikasi ini jika anda sedang tersesat :p\r\n\r\nBisa dibayangkan bahwa AR bukan hanya sebuah teknologi dengan presentasi yang <em>cool</em> saja tapi langsung dapat kita rasakan kegunaannya. Saat ini pun aplikasi-aplikasi besar semacam <em>Layar</em> dan <em>Wikitude</em> membuka API mereka untuk memicu inovasi-inovasi selanjutnya kegunaan AR. Bersiaplah karena dalam beberapa waktu ke depan, akan ada lebih banyak aplikasi AR lagi dan lebih banyak kegunaannya.","html":"<p>Sebelum mulai dengan artikel ini, saya <em>refresh</em> dulu memori istri-istri AR.

Disinilah peranan istri kelima AR atau <em>Web</em> menjadi penting. <em>Smartphone</em> anda <em>most likely</em> terhubung dengan Internet, dengan begitu penyedia layanan lokasi semacam <a href=\"http://www.urbanesia.com\" target=\"_blank\">Urbanesia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.koprol.com\" target=\"_blank\">Koprol</a>, <a href=\"http://www.citzel.com\" target=\"_blank\">Citzel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foursquare.com\" target=\"_blank\">Foursquare</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gowalla.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gowalla</a> dan lain-lain dapat dikomunikasikan dengan aplikasi untuk melihat apa saja yang ada di sekitar anda.</p>\n\n<p>Sudah banyak aplikasi di berbagai <em>platform</em> yang dapat berkomunikasi dengan penyedia layanan lokasi dan menampilkannya dalam modus AR kepada anda. Ada 3 <em>mobile platform</em> besar yang dapat dibuatkan aplikasi AR yaitu <em>Android</em>, <em>iPhone</em> dan <em>Symbian</em>. Sangat disayangkan masih belum ada <em>mobile platform</em> lain yang membukakan pintu bagi AR agar dapat dinikmati khayalak umum.</p>\n\n<p>Berbicara tentang aplikasi, satu per satu akan saya bahas aplikasinya dan <em>mobile platform</em> yang didukung. Yang pertama adalah <em><a href=\"http://www.layar.com\" target=\"_blank\">Layar</a></em>, salah satu early adopter untuk AR dan tersedia di <em>Android</em> awalnya dan sekarang juga di <em>iPhone</em>. Lalu ada <a href=\"http://www.wikitude.org\" target=\"_blank\">Wikitude</a> yang tersedia di ketiga mobile platform <em>Android</em>, <em>iPhone</em> dan <em>Symbian</em>. Dari Indonesia pun juga sudah ada jika anda menggunakan Android, lihat saja <a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/blog/2010/poligamy-ar-now-available-at-android-market\" target=\"_blank\">disini</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Masih banyak aplikasi-aplikasi lainnya yang menggunakan AR dengan kegunaan yang berbeda-beda pula. Satu aplikasi yang saya yakin dapat anda langsung syukuri kegunaannya adalah <a href=\"http://www.androlib.com/android.application.mkt-com-phyora-augsatnav-qtiC.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><em>AugSatNav</em></a> yang tersedia di Android. Dengan aplikasi ini, anda dapat melihat arah dalam bentuk 3D langsung diproyeksikan di kamera <em>smartphone</em> anda. Bayangkan <em>use case</em> aplikasi ini jika anda sedang tersesat :p</p>\n\n<p>Bisa dibayangkan bahwa AR bukan hanya sebuah teknologi dengan presentasi yang <em>cool</em> saja tapi langsung dapat kita rasakan kegunaannya. Saat ini pun aplikasi-aplikasi besar semacam <em>Layar</em> dan <em>Wikitude</em> membuka API mereka untuk memicu inovasi-inovasi selanjutnya kegunaan AR. Bersiaplah karena dalam beberapa waktu ke depan, akan ada lebih banyak aplikasi AR lagi dan lebih banyak kegunaannya.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1387126097923,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1387126097923,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1274465613000,"published_by":1},{"id":65,"uuid":"34b22eef-6742-4689-9ad1-196daa98d43b","title":"Update Your Nexus One to Froyo - Android 2.2 NOW!","slug":"update-your-nexus-one-to-froyo-android-2-2-now","markdown":"I'm one of the happiest Nexus One owner today!

I'm a developer running a web startup. There are 2 things in the previous sentence that makes me smile every time I think about it. Let's dive in.\r\n\r\n<strong>I AM A DEVELOPER</strong>\r\n\r\nI'm lucky enough to be one of the few to work in something that I have loved ever since I laid my eyes on. I fell in love initially with a 8088XT running <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digger_(computer_game)\" target=\"_blank\">Digger</a>. I basically wrecked a couple of PCs while learning about it. Anyways, because of the profound impact of computers in such an early age, I was very up to date about technologies back then. In fact I was one of Internet's early adopters here in Indonesia. The first thing I did when I knew about WWW, I signed up for a free website at Geocities, that was in 1996.\r\n\r\nFrom the paragraph above I hope you can feel what kind of relationship I have with computers especially the Internet. I studied and practiced web based technologies since I was in college. Enough to have my own money but I didn't really know how to manage the money. Well as I said, it was college and everything was just so pressure-less lol.\r\n\r\nI went to college 2 times in 2 different colleges and countries, yet I didn't graduate from any of them. It's not because I didn't want to, I want to but life expected a different outcome from me. I decided to hack my way into life's challenges. I had the skills technically, I just need to manage it.\r\n\r\nDuring this part of life I felt a little bit discouraged looking into the reality everywhere that developers are often thought as a handyman/woman only. This is also encouraged by developers' own mentality so for someone unique, the ecosystem is threatening to say the least.\r\n\r\nI did office jobs, freelancing and both at the same time. The only freedom was by being a freelancer. I did it mostly when I was still having an office job. For me, I got lucky that most of the company I worked for didn't care too much about my freelance activities as long as I got their work done. But I believe others have different experiences.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that hinders me as a developer is my designing skills. As much as I want to be able to do it on my own, I can't. This is a fact I've learned to accept and manage. But this opened me up to a new lesson, I have to understand others in my team which are designers. Developers and designers are both unique in mentality but dependent on one another lol. Understand others so that others understand us.\r\n\r\n<strong>I'M RUNNING A WEB STARTUP</strong>\r\n\r\nThe second point is written boldly above. I never thought of having one on my own when I started out <a href=\"http://mediafusion.web.id\" target=\"_blank\">Mediafusion</a>. The objective was to legalize my freelance jobs and expand the market by teaming up with my partners. As time goes by, we needed more exposure but we were cautious about the amount of money needed to get more exposure. So I thought, promotional activities will cost big time, in the end it can be as big as the cost of starting up a web startup. So we choose to start a web startup.\r\n\r\nAn important point about partnering is noted by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/rampok\" target=\"_blank\">Rama of DailySocial.net</a> in one of his articles <a href=\"http://dailysocial.net/2010/05/16/co-founder-menemukan-sang-belahan-jiwa/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I learned and knew by experience anything I needed to about running a web startup but my partners didn't. I choose partners that are <strong>NOT</strong> in the web scene. Why? Because I needed their experience and the diversities. If we are to create something that the average people will use, I will need average people to create it with. My ideas and views are biased by my experiences. Synergy is the key.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that the so called web startup is still in the making and I haven't published anything yet. We are now working round the clock to do so. Again I'm lucky and grateful that in the course of starting this web startup, I met with the brilliant men and women of <a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/category/startuplokal\" target=\"_blank\">StartupLokal</a>. I was enlightened that this climate of bootstrapping is experienced by others alike. We shared our experiences and opened up new business ventures with one another.\r\n\r\nThe big bang was yesterday when <a href=\"http://blog.koprol.com/2010/05/yahoo-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo acquired Koprol</a>. It opened up a whole new opportunity for startups like mine to be acknowledge from far away. Indonesia is now a blip on the radar and I'm sure Indonesia have a lot to offer, just have to know where to look.\r\n\r\n<strong>EMPOWERING YOURSELVES</strong>\r\n\r\nThis article is actually <strong>NOT</strong> about me. It's about you developers! I just want to show you that you as a developer can sit at the driver's seat. You are the most creative and knowledgeable person when it comes to the actual product/startup itself. You can find your way around code dead-ends and still prevail. Most importantly the life of the product/startup is in your gracious hands.\r\n\r\nBefore actually making your jump, please make sure that you understand yourselves. When you start a business, the biggest enemy is not your competitor, it's you and your ego. People doesn't wanna know the technology behind the whole experience, they just want to use it however they like. It's not about the technology. Technology is a key ingredient but there are other ingredients that are also important like Marketing. If your product is really cool, futuristic and worthy to be presented to the average people, make it your marketing gimmick. Without marketing, no one will ever know you exist. Nowadays social network is playing a big role on how people decide. Use this as your advantage.\r\n\r\nSecondly, code if you have to but don't do it if you don't have to. Let your mind be focused in something else and delegate to others. When you start initially, you damn sure have to code a large chunk of the product but when you're in a position to be able to hire others, let them do it. Teach the wisdom of your ways and let them develop the right mentality. With it, the codes will inherit the positivity of the developer. You on the other hand have to take care the business side of the product/startup and it will make you have one of those days when your dreams looked so far away. <strong>If you do feel your dream is far, then it is, so don't!</strong>\r\n\r\nThe last piece of advise will be to network yourself and do your own branding among the community. The product/startup is actually all about yourselves. Make others see that, that with your vision, it will go a long long long long long long way. Be open for critics and understand that perspective is everything.\r\n\r\nSo there you go developers, from now own, you're your own startup!","html":"<p>It's with pride if I answer questions about what I do.

No regrets though, their presentation rocked the house! It made people realize how big a market is in Indonesia and monetizing it is not impossible.\r\n\r\n<p id=\"__ss_4373166\" style=\"width: 425px;\"><object id=\"__sse4373166\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=monetizingindonesiainternetmobile-100601023359-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=monetizing-indonesia-internet-mobile\" /><param name=\"name\" value=\"__sse4373166\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed id=\"__sse4373166\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=monetizingindonesiainternetmobile-100601023359-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=monetizing-indonesia-internet-mobile\" name=\"__sse4373166\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nTheir presentation was right on and precise to say the least! I tweeted some points that I think we all should know and grasp it to our own startups:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>In Indonesia adoption is tricky. Don't sleep with just anyone (everyone), pick a wife/husband. The context for this is telco operators. Pick a side from all of them.</li>\r\n\t<li>Telco operators in Indonesia doesn't care about your ideas, your platform, your apps and or your technology. There's only one thing on their mind which is users quantity. The more the merrier.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI was also sitting beside a guy from AdMob Indonesia (never knew AdMob has an Indonesian rep). He told me stuffs about AdMob's Android analytics in Indonesia. It's quite impressive by the way. The past month, Indonesia racked up 2 million impressions. For a mobile platform with a slow start in Indonesia, I purely believe it's a good sign of what's to come. It's just too bad that AdMob is not supporting Location Based ads.

I tweeted some points that I think we all should know and grasp it to our own startups:  </p>\n\n<ol>  \n    <li>In Indonesia adoption is tricky. Don't sleep with just anyone (everyone), pick a wife/husband. The context for this is telco operators. Pick a side from all of them.</li>\n    <li>Telco operators in Indonesia doesn't care about your ideas, your platform, your apps and or your technology. There's only one thing on their mind which is users quantity. The more the merrier.</li>\n</ol>  \n\n<p>I was also sitting beside a guy from AdMob Indonesia (never knew AdMob has an Indonesian rep). He told me stuffs about AdMob's Android analytics in Indonesia. It's quite impressive by the way. The past month, Indonesia racked up 2 million impressions. For a mobile platform with a slow start in Indonesia, I purely believe it's a good sign of what's to come. It's just too bad that AdMob is not supporting Location Based ads. At least let our application gets the location fixing and we'll send the API the location.</p>\n\n<p>I went back home to clean up and get a shower before going to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/rampok\" target=\"_blank\">@rampok's</a> place in Bussora Street.

So politely for fanboys, I'm just expressing my experience using both. It's a love and hate relationship for me so both are winners andÂ losers.\r\n\r\nThe first of the two that I own and used everyday is an iPhone 3G 8 Gigs. I must tell you that every iPhone is a masterpiece of great User Interface (UI) design. I love the easing effects applied, it DOES NOT feel artificial and mostly missable. Overall it looks great!\r\n\r\nThe only weak point for the whole UI that I can give is its Home Screen. Sooner or later it will feel crowded by default. I say this because without installing another addon app to free yourselves from Home Screen clutters, it will be messy. Well that won't be the case if you routinely keep it tidy like grouping certain apps/games according to your preferences.\r\n\r\nNext on the list is Mobile Network connectivity. It basically sucks. My iPhone kept on loosing signal strength to a point where sometimes it's just playing dead with the help of a nearby wifi access point which is actually very lame on its function to serve as a mobile Internet device.\r\n\r\nThe third thing is looking it from a developer point of view. It costs money for me to distribute my app to the mass. There is no official way of publishing your app unless paying $99 for an iPhone Developer account at Apple.com. In the west and other parts of the world, it's not a meaningful barrier but for independent developer like myself, it's surely a pain the butt to pay for it. There are workarounds like Jailbreaking and using black hat methods but it's just extra work for something that is flesh and blood for every developers.\r\n\r\nWith the iPhone HD (4G) now nearing its launch date, I hope to see more from Apple. One thing that I fell in love is iAds. The ability to integrate it directly with Xcode is a genius idea! Well other platform have SDKs but I still need to import them directly to my project and this is not pretty compared to what Apple is offering. I'm just gonna wait and see for this one.\r\n\r\nMoving on to Android. I have a Google Nexus One right now and after Blackberry, it's the most satisfying investment for a mobile device for me. First of all, it's Google made and for that reason, throughout my experience, Google seems to love developers very much. They just makes everything easy. Even for rooting your devices.\r\n\r\nThe rush for Android is already happening in the US. I strongly believe it's just a matter of time before Indonesia gets a hold of it. Hopefully mobile device vendors don't make the same mistakes Apple did entrusting their iPhone to a single operator albeit the biggest. There's not enough competition for the device and therefore marketing is scarce.\r\n\r\nBack to Android. First of all, from a graphical point of view, it's behind iPhone but not so much. What it lacks with graphics, it substitutes with a great UI. I found Android's UI increases my productivity way more than an iPhone did me.\r\n\r\nI love what Google did with their Home Screen. It basically is the killer for iPhone. The whole application is grouped into one menu and out of the 5 Home Screens available, you can just put app shortcuts, widgets and Live Wallpaper.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't heard about Live Wallpaper, it's a wallpaper that actually interacts with your taps on the screen. Google it for more info.\r\n\r\nNext up is its connectivity with the Mobile Network. It's EXCELLENT. I'm on the Froyo ROM right now and falling in love deeply with its fixed 3 soft-buttons on the bottom-center which are Phone, Apps and Browser. That's the 3 things I always do with my Nexus One and Google figured that out correctly.\r\n\r\nNow comparing head-to-head with an iPhone's easing effects, for this part Android is lightyears behind. I can see Android is designing a great UI from zero in a macro way but Apple edged any Android devices right with Apple's attentions to details. You just can't beat Apple's consistencies and innovation with their designing efforts. At least not right now.\r\n\r\nSo for me if I have to choose between the two, I will definitely choose Android. Not only because I'm subjectively also consider myself as an Android evangelist but also because it's the future. You see, Google is always launching things feature limited or not as good as others. However, Google usually has its own fond for others to make us of its platform and modifying it the way we like it. Again, it's just a matter of time.\r\n\r\nI develop Android apps with great ease because of all the resources available to learn and just adopt it rapidly. Let me tell you firsthand, I'm originally a Web Developer based with PHP. Right now, I'm experiencing a rather smooth transition to Android. Because it's in Java, there are 2 big barriers for me which are syntax and a more firm understanding of Object Oriented Programming. Other than that, I'm a happy developer.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, let me say once again that this is NOT an objective opinion. I am biased by my own experiences between the two so take what's useful for you and make your ownÂ decision. I'm a happy Android users :)","html":"<p>Let everyone who is reading this be warned that this is NOT an objective article about either of the platform.

We gathered at Pizza e Birra, Plaza Indonesia EX and watched SVN vs ENG afterwards right there.\r\n\r\nThe agenda of the meeting was to talk about the directions of where StartupLokal is going. Out of all the interesting topics, one topic that caught my attention was how to be a StartupLokal. I guess here in Indonesia you guys as a StartupLokal would agree that although it's time consuming, money-vacuum, sleepless nights, change of biology clock, uncertainty and all the other traits of being one; it's a risk we all are more than willing to take and getting through it one smile at a day.\r\n\r\nI had a StartupLokal in 2006 and it went down as soon as it went up. The team couldn't scale it financially at the time. With the resource I have right, I'm sure it will be a different story. For me it was a happy experience albeit its failure. I get to learn what bootstrapping is without even knowing that word exists until just a month ago. The team was a team of SUPERMEN. We devour every technical obstacles without even blinking. While we were still on a shared hosting, we managed to bring the whole server down and got my reseller account suspended. After moving into a dedicated server, we adapted quick in a FreeBSD environment, it wasn't as user-friendly as Linux is but it was way faster.\r\n\r\nFrom a programming point of view, we optimized everything from optimizing database queries to scheduling database INSERTs. According to AWStats, with its lifespan of 9 months, we accumulated around 14 million hits. That's BIG even for now. While there are a lot of hits, it wasn't unique because of the way the website is all about. Nevertheless, we had to scale a single server with it application and database server as one to accomodate around 1.5 million hits a month with a very limited hardware configuration. We succeeded technically speaking.\r\n\r\nWhen it reached its ninth month, we had spend a lot of money. We didn't get any income and bills are still coming. The marketing was just NOT working.

We gathered at Pizza e Birra, Plaza Indonesia EX and watched SVN vs ENG afterwards right there.</p>\n\n<p>The agenda of the meeting was to talk about the directions of where StartupLokal is going. Out of all the interesting topics, one topic that caught my attention was how to be a StartupLokal. I guess here in Indonesia you guys as a StartupLokal would agree that although it's time consuming, money-vacuum, sleepless nights, change of biology clock, uncertainty and all the other traits of being one; it's a risk we all are more than willing to take and getting through it one smile at a day.</p>\n\n<p>I had a StartupLokal in 2006 and it went down as soon as it went up. The team couldn't scale it financially at the time. With the resource I have right, I'm sure it will be a different story. For me it was a happy experience albeit its failure. I get to learn what bootstrapping is without even knowing that word exists until just a month ago. The team was a team of SUPERMEN. We devour every technical obstacles without even blinking. While we were still on a shared hosting, we managed to bring the whole server down and got my reseller account suspended. After moving into a dedicated server, we adapted quick in a FreeBSD environment, it wasn't as user-friendly as Linux is but it was way faster.</p>\n\n<p>From a programming point of view, we optimized everything from optimizing database queries to scheduling database INSERTs. According to AWStats, with its lifespan of 9 months, we accumulated around 14 million hits. That's BIG even for now. While there are a lot of hits, it wasn't unique because of the way the website is all about. Nevertheless, we had to scale a single server with it application and database server as one to accomodate around 1.5 million hits a month with a very limited hardware configuration. We succeeded technically speaking.</p>\n\n<p>When it reached its ninth month, we had spend a lot of money. We didn't get any income and bills are still coming. The marketing was just NOT working. We didn't have a model to which a web startup can fit in. We did it all only with heart and passion. Well I tell you, it's not enough.</p>\n\n<p>Many of you will argue my last sentence above I'm sure. If you are already a StartupLokal then I will say, your heart will not monetize your website BUT your heart will give endurance above your own expectations.

I'm gonna try to write unbiased and let you all decide for yourselves.

Yes Android apps have the ability to be spyware like any other app in any other platform.\r\n\r\nI believe compared with Apple's tight leash with its own App Store, Android is not as solid. With Apple, every app goes into moderation every time it's submitted for App Store distribution (the only distribution I might add). Apple must do rigorous QA testing to ensure the quality of each app. This will most definitely cut down the number of malicious apps but still possible to do evil things.\r\n\r\nThe problem with Android is education to its end users. As a developer, I'm exposed to the mechanism that Android apps have to adhere to. Android Market is an open platform in a sense that it allows the users to vote, comment and decide for themselves the apps listed. Prior to installation of every app, permissions with every app's manifest files are exposed to the user. So every activity an app do, users do know initially.\r\n\r\nNow it's back to the end users to allow the actual app itself be installed with a set of permissions initially. If the app has nothing to do with Internet connection or even accessing your phonebook, then it's the user's choice <strong>NOT</strong> to install the app. In short, as a user, we must be smart in our own capacities.\r\n\r\nGoogle is NOT doing a good job in educating its users of these risk potentials I must admit. They must do something and I'm more than happy to advocate. They have created a democracy system. In every country, bad guys exists; so is in the virtual world.

Because everything is transparent, well documented and straight-forward. This is what an app should be. It's up to you guys as developers to create apps that are great and users to define which is app is great. So it's like a cycle of co-dependencyÂ between the two.\r\n\r\nSo I believe Google have created a virtual ecosystem that mimics the real world perfectly.

Aside from being a full day, it's a day of happiness for me personally andÂ professionally. My biology clock today was a bit off, but it's well worth the day.\r\n\r\nThe day started at 00:00 and at that time I was in front of my MacBook coding. I sometimes wonder why I code. I was coding for a dream I once had with friends and wanting to live the dream again. Thank God Code Igniter is there to the rescue. Coding is almost effortless with Code Igniter lol.\r\n\r\nFinished the coding fiesta 07:00 in the morning when my body is telling to stop. Fell asleep with my hands on the keyboard lol. I woke up very late around 15:00 only to find there's nothing to eat. That's when my mind told me to code again but this time is food coding hahaha. My brother bought a pack of bacon and another pack of salami. That's the combination I want for a late lunch. Nasi Goreng is the easiest and voila, Nasi Goreng with Bacon and Salami. I ate while watching my brother trained his pet eagle. He's good at it, he did it all only with a whistle, NICE!\r\n\r\nAfter that I was off to my soon-to-be wife Yosephine's office. Picked her up to go to our last Pre-Marital guidance at Church. Did you know how long I waited for this? Almost 2 years! When we got there, we thought it'll be another experience and Q&amp;A session. We were wrong. It was the day when we were given a license that we are now both eligible for marriage :D It was only pieces of paper but it's meaningful for us. We followed through the whole process from zero and now we're getting closer to the real deal. It made me remember why we are getting married.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the session at Church, we were taught to differentiate between what we want and what we need. Thanks to J, He showed us what we need which is each other. We both came a long way from the day we met. From buses, taxis, bikes and being stuck in traffic in Jakarta, we did it all. So I guess we must be thankful for problems, without problems, there's no improvement. We've had our share of problems and we are still together. One thing that I'm very grateful is her support for my own business. From a freelancer, employee and now a #StartupLokal, she's been there all the way. All this is because of His mercy and LOVE for all of us.\r\n\r\nI didn't thought I could make it to East Venture's event but J gave way. I managed to come although I was late. I don't know why but I was really happy meeting startups. We are all going through the same thing each one of us. Some are already established, some are on their way being established and some are just starting. During my conversations, none of them regretted theirÂ decisionsÂ and so did I. Doing something you love is the best that can happen. Did you know the <a href=\"http://www.scraplr.com\" target=\"_blank\">Scraplr</a> guys stayed the night at Gambir station on our last #StartupLokal meetup? This is how far passion can take you. Hell, it took them to Echelon 2010 to pitch their startup. Being a startup today opens up more opportunities than never before. Although the business climate for startups is very unique here in Indonesia yet we are all still alive.\r\n\r\nAgain I must say that passion is never ending. Look at Hitler, his passion although crazy,Â disgustingÂ and inhumane made him from a disappointed painter to the character we all knew. Even the mustache is a sign of a passionate man lol. My point is, passion is what makes any startup a success story. Success is measured differently between startups but I bet every little achievement you can accomplish is a fight well fought. Maybe that's why investors invest on the founders, our passion can't be measured with money but it can certainly make money lol.\r\n\r\nI then went with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/rampok\" target=\"_blank\">@rampok</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.evolitera.co.id\" target=\"_blank\">Evolitera</a> guys to watch Nederlands incredible come-from-behind victory over Brazil. After the match, Rama showed me the new design for <a href=\"http://www.dailysocial.net\" target=\"_blank\">DailySocial.net</a>. I liked it. The first thing that caught my eye was the clean white background. I just love white, it shows a lot of LOVE you know! Because I feel it is exactly who Rama is. He loves what he do and his own startup is prove. I really enjoy debating over startup things or web with him. So Rama, <strong>ON THE RECORD</strong>, you're the geekiest pimp and that's a compliment &amp; insult both at the same time hahahahahaha. Can't wait for the English version of DailySocial.net though, would love to contribute ;)\r\n\r\nIt's a great day for my future and all because of J.

Very happy to integrate with Urbanesia with the role Chief Innovation Officer.</p>\n\n<p>Selina Limman, CEO of Urbanesia told at Urbanesia's blog <a href=\"http://blog.urbanesia.com/2010/7/573/nkotb-batista-harahap\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> a short recap on how this all began. From my point of view, I just love Urbanesia's currently over than 200.000 POIs database. No other local website is enriched with that much data and its quality is an example to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Rama from his post <a href=\"http://dailysocial.net/2010/07/07/urbanesia-hilang-cto-dapat-cio/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> have said much about what's going to happen next. An emphasize on Urbanesia's API will be added with more features this coming month. Soon this much data will be made available through the use of Urbanesia's API as a web service. Another priority with great importance is getting Urbanesia out from its Beta phase. This will be aligned in parallel with Urbanesia API.

What made me comfortable instantly was its UI. Everything is right where they're supposed to be enabling me to Tweet without being confused small buttons for my thumb.\n\nThe paid version offers a bigger widget applet. I paid for this app not because of the widget but because it's just plainly great!</li>  \n    <li>Robo Defense Free - <a href=\"http://lupislabs.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lupis Labs</a>\nIf you ask me why the free version, it's because I can't pay for it without doing some workarounds.

Held every first Thursday of the month. A quick statistic overview, tonight there are over than 103 participants registered. I'm sure there are more because not everyone is registered. The complete statistics for the event will be published ASAP.\r\n\r\nI must say that it's one of the most well planned and surprisingly packed with web celebs tonight's #StartupLokal event. Tonight the men and women of Google from 3 different divisions came. Better late than never right? After a chat with Eugenie from Google Singapore, she told me about Google's plans in Indonesia. I can't say much but it is with good faith I say: <em>It's about time Google, where have you been all this time?</em>\r\n\r\nTonight at #StartupLokal is a witness of the first event held with a stable and broadband level Internet connection. A Wimax receiver at the gate of Sriti Ballroom is like a welcoming signage :) Thank you <a href=\"http://www.trg.co.id\" target=\"_blank\">TRG</a> for providing us with all the goodies and freebies, most of #StartupLokal are bootstrappers, it's great to experience these treats once in a while.\r\n\r\nA well organized and prepared event is another milestone for #StartupLokal. The credit should mostly go to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/novpratama\" target=\"_blank\">@novpratama</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/phoetz\" target=\"_blank\">@phoetz</a> for their valued support to the community. We had 2 pre-event meetings and numerous emails back and forth to make sure this event not only serve as an event but also an experience. Please accept my gratitude :)\r\n\r\nIf you guys take a moment and search for #<a href=\"http://twitter.com/search?q=%23StartupLokal\" target=\"_blank\">StartupLokal hashtag</a> on Twitter, you will see that most of the people who came were feeling empowered by the amount of energy and passion that are uploaded and downloaded during the event. That is what #StartupLokal is all about I feel. If you guys have seen Inception, you would appreciate how an idea can either corrupt people or instead empower them to be more and beyond who you are right now. Self development is key to successful startup, after all, <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/tistaharahap/bancakan-v5-selling-me\" target=\"_blank\">YOU ARE YOUR OWN STARTUP</a></strong>.\r\n\r\nSo to close a wonderful night, I must say that tonight like in every startup's plans, #StartupLokal has just reached a new milestone. This milestone still have lots of room for improvement and that's the kind of build up I'm talking about in the blog post title. When we're done improving, the fun time starts: INNOVATION. For an event that is only 4 months old, #StartupLokal is growing exponentially.\r\n\r\nDo you guys ever realize that we startups sell intangible products we can't actually touch? And yet it sells ;)","html":"<p>Okay it's 20 minutes after 1 AM, just got home and now writing about my favorite event every month: #StartupLokal. Held every first Thursday of the month.

A Wimax receiver at the gate of Sriti Ballroom is like a welcoming signage :) Thank you <a href=\"http://www.trg.co.id\" target=\"_blank\">TRG</a> for providing us with all the goodies and freebies, most of #StartupLokal are bootstrappers, it's great to experience these treats once in a while.</p>\n\n<p>A well organized and prepared event is another milestone for #StartupLokal. The credit should mostly go to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/novpratama\" target=\"_blank\">@novpratama</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/phoetz\" target=\"_blank\">@phoetz</a> for their valued support to the community. We had 2 pre-event meetings and numerous emails back and forth to make sure this event not only serve as an event but also an experience. Please accept my gratitude :)</p>\n\n<p>If you guys take a moment and search for #<a href=\"http://twitter.com/search?q=%23StartupLokal\" target=\"_blank\">StartupLokal hashtag</a> on Twitter, you will see that most of the people who came were feeling empowered by the amount of energy and passion that are uploaded and downloaded during the event. That is what #StartupLokal is all about I feel. If you guys have seen Inception, you would appreciate how an idea can either corrupt people or instead empower them to be more and beyond who you are right now. Self development is key to successful startup, after all, <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/tistaharahap/bancakan-v5-selling-me\" target=\"_blank\">YOU ARE YOUR OWN STARTUP</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So to close a wonderful night, I must say that tonight like in every startup's plans, #StartupLokal has just reached a new milestone. This milestone still have lots of room for improvement and that's the kind of build up I'm talking about in the blog post title. When we're done improving, the fun time starts: INNOVATION. For an event that is only 4 months old, #StartupLokal is growing exponentially.</p>\n\n<p>Do you guys ever realize that we startups sell intangible products we can't actually touch? And yet it sells ;)</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1387126098017,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1387126098017,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1281059695000,"published_by":1},{"id":87,"uuid":"1c6d1587-90df-44b7-8a9e-58aeff6c4959","title":"Happy 7th of August Everyone!","slug":"happy-7th-of-august-everyone","markdown":"Yeay the best part of every year :) Thanks for all the wishes guys!

Okay this particular issue has bugged me twice in the last 3 months and it's suffice to say, I must share this with other developers who might be experiencing the same issue.\r\n\r\nYes it's the Urbanesia app I'm talking about :) Today was planned to release the app to Android Market. So I uploaded the app to my Market Publisher account and filled all the required info and graphics. I did a search with my Nexus One and it showed correctly. Asked for help with some friends using Samsung Spica and Motorola Droid, it showed correctly on their phones. After that, the Nexian Journey was next. It didn't show up :(\r\n\r\nI dug through the usual channels only to find that I was not alone with this annoying bug from Android Market. Other developers are experiencing the same old thing. This is a guide of what to be done when you're caught in the middle of it.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Make sure that all your Android Manifest permissions and features are formatted with <strong>android:required=\"false\"</strong> or <strong>required=\"false\"</strong> if the particular permission or feature is a luxury with different phone models. The documentation showed that there are default values if not explicitly defined, however Android Market is not in sync with the documentation.

Okay this particular issue has bugged me twice in the last 3 months and it's suffice to say, I must share this with other developers who might be experiencing the same issue.</p>\n\n<p>Yes it's the Urbanesia app I'm talking about :) Today was planned to release the app to Android Market. So I uploaded the app to my Market Publisher account and filled all the required info and graphics. I did a search with my Nexus One and it showed correctly. Asked for help with some friends using Samsung Spica and Motorola Droid, it showed correctly on their phones. After that, the Nexian Journey was next. It didn't show up :(</p>\n\n<p>I dug through the usual channels only to find that I was not alone with this annoying bug from Android Market. Other developers are experiencing the same old thing.

Examples:\n<ul>  \n    <li>&lt;uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.camera.autofocus\" /&gt; should be formatted as &lt;uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.camera.autofocus\" required=\"false\" /&gt;</li>\n    <li>&lt;uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\" /&gt; should be formatted as &lt;uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\" android:required=\"false\" /&gt;</li>\n</ul>  \n</li>  \n    <li>Remove this particular permission from your Android Manifest:\n<ul>  \n    <li>&lt;uses-permission id=\"<em>android</em>.permission.<em>CALL_PHONE</em>\" /&gt; instead use this with your source code <strong>Intent callIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_DIAL);</strong></li>\n</ul>  \n</li>  \n    <li>Do not Copy Protect your app from your Android Market Publisher console or your app will only be visible to Android Market \"included\" phones that has their respective fingerprint registered.

To be honest, this blog post is inspired by one of the earliest episode of Heroes when Nathan and his Mom told Peter that he is having illusions of grandeur. Evidently, Peter became one of the most talented and gifted mutant of them all, he figured out how to gain any power he wants without killing the subject unlike Sylar lol.\r\n\r\nWell subjectively I must say that thinking BIG is a blessing. It gives you vision and therefore a purpose in whatever you are trying to achieve in the future. The right sense of purpose can bring you anywhere you want to be at any point in your lives. Everyone's is welcomed to debate this point anytime :)\r\n\r\nNow to put into perspective, building and maintaining Urbanesia almost from scratch is a BIG thing. Grandeur is a requirement for everyone involved and may I say subjectively (again), the kind of thought that our Web Developer team must have. Because of the nature of Urbanesia, it is important for each one of us developers to have a firm grasp of the bigger picture. Some things are just NOT a bargain.\r\n\r\nThis is why I imposed a new policy which is also one of the principle I withhold: <strong>LESS IS MORE</strong>! As developers, we all know our biggest enemy, it's that thirst for doing everything efficiently. The strength of a developer and also the weakest of any. I don't know, maybe because efficiency is interpreted differently with different developers. For me efficiency means less load and to achieve that, the codebase should be as slim as possible.\r\n\r\nWe achieved a big performance gain with our new v1.0 by streamlining the MY_Controller part of our Codeigniter Framework to less than 800 lines of codes. We love Object Oriented Programming (OOP) but we hate overusing OOP to a point where it should be abbreviated as <em>OOPS</em>.\r\n\r\nFor most of mid to advanced developer, OOP is a comfort zone and as with any comfort zone, it's NOT good in the long run. Now why do I say such a <strong>BOLD</strong> statement? Because instantiating a class takes a lot of memory and CPU cycles! Codeigniter itself is a giant in disguise, it basically wraps all the MVC into one big object. This is a liability and surely you will notice heavy memory usage.\r\n\r\nNow how do Urbanesia solve this dilemma? As I said before, Less is More and therefore make everything as simple as possible. From hundreds of controllers, we slimmed down to only 33 controllers. Why do we optimized the controllers first? That's the million dollar question. Simple, it's where all the logic happens, it's where CPU cycles are heavy and most importantly by slimming down to just 33 controllers, we saved significant amount of overheads by NOT instantiating too many classes.\r\n\r\nHow about the Views you asked? Well we love views but we also hate views. Views are always generated dynamically and therefore, it's NOT the most efficient way to display contents. Views also contains iterations and loops to display data. This is a resource hogger too. So what should we do? A lot!\r\n\r\nFirst of all, cache it! Yes we love cache, without cache, Urbanesia won't be as fast as it is right now. Disk cache is of great importance. We are building static HTML files of every dynamically generated content of Urbanesia. Now you ask why we do this when we have Memcached? Because I'd rather have Disk I/O rather than CPU Cycles. Our servers are already using the fastest SAS Harddrives available, why not make us of it to the max!\r\n\r\nAnother gem is HTML5. After Google DevFest earlier this month, the team was inspired to built an SVN like mechanism in JavaScript for visitors to fetch increments instead of the whole website.

Thanks for reading, I'm leaving you with a quote.\r\n<blockquote><em>You're <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">GREAT</span>! Get used to it!</em></blockquote>","html":"<p>Okay the title is a WTF right? To be honest, this blog post is inspired by one of the earliest episode of Heroes when Nathan and his Mom told Peter that he is having illusions of grandeur. Evidently, Peter became one of the most talented and gifted mutant of them all, he figured out how to gain any power he wants without killing the subject unlike Sylar lol.</p>\n\n<p>Well subjectively I must say that thinking BIG is a blessing. It gives you vision and therefore a purpose in whatever you are trying to achieve in the future. The right sense of purpose can bring you anywhere you want to be at any point in your lives. Everyone's is welcomed to debate this point anytime :)</p>\n\n<p>Now to put into perspective, building and maintaining Urbanesia almost from scratch is a BIG thing. Grandeur is a requirement for everyone involved and may I say subjectively (again), the kind of thought that our Web Developer team must have. Because of the nature of Urbanesia, it is important for each one of us developers to have a firm grasp of the bigger picture. Some things are just NOT a bargain.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I imposed a new policy which is also one of the principle I withhold: <strong>LESS IS MORE</strong>! As developers, we all know our biggest enemy, it's that thirst for doing everything efficiently. The strength of a developer and also the weakest of any. I don't know, maybe because efficiency is interpreted differently with different developers. For me efficiency means less load and to achieve that, the codebase should be as slim as possible.</p>\n\n<p>We achieved a big performance gain with our new v1.0 by streamlining the MY_Controller part of our Codeigniter Framework to less than 800 lines of codes. We love Object Oriented Programming (OOP) but we hate overusing OOP to a point where it should be abbreviated as <em>OOPS</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For most of mid to advanced developer, OOP is a comfort zone and as with any comfort zone, it's NOT good in the long run. Now why do I say such a <strong>BOLD</strong> statement? Because instantiating a class takes a lot of memory and CPU cycles! Codeigniter itself is a giant in disguise, it basically wraps all the MVC into one big object. This is a liability and surely you will notice heavy memory usage.</p>\n\n<p>Now how do Urbanesia solve this dilemma? As I said before, Less is More and therefore make everything as simple as possible. From hundreds of controllers, we slimmed down to only 33 controllers. Why do we optimized the controllers first? That's the million dollar question. Simple, it's where all the logic happens, it's where CPU cycles are heavy and most importantly by slimming down to just 33 controllers, we saved significant amount of overheads by NOT instantiating too many classes.</p>\n\n<p>How about the Views you asked? Well we love views but we also hate views. Views are always generated dynamically and therefore, it's NOT the most efficient way to display contents. Views also contains iterations and loops to display data. This is a resource hogger too. So what should we do? A lot!</p>\n\n<p>First of all, cache it! Yes we love cache, without cache, Urbanesia won't be as fast as it is right now. Disk cache is of great importance. We are building static HTML files of every dynamically generated content of Urbanesia. Now you ask why we do this when we have Memcached? Because I'd rather have Disk I/O rather than CPU Cycles. Our servers are already using the fastest SAS Harddrives available, why not make us of it to the max!</p>\n\n<p>Another gem is HTML5. After Google DevFest earlier this month, the team was inspired to built an SVN like mechanism in JavaScript for visitors to fetch increments instead of the whole website. This will be a significant boost towards productivity load-wise. By only serving increments, we are projecting of cutting down more than 30-40% of the entire load. Non-HTML5 browsers are already accounted.</p>\n\n<p>O yea by the way, our team of Superhero Geeks are named Betanesia, follow us <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Betanesia\" target=\"_blank\">@Betanesia</a>.

At first glance, it's complicated when looking at an already made sphinx.conf. However, after careful redesigning andÂ re-tinkering, it turns out to be one of the most flexible and yet light fulltext search engine available today.Â There are others but nothing as light, fast and sleek as Sphinx. The cold truth is that Sphinx is supporting SQL based databases as far as I know. Since Urbanesia is already using MySQL as our backend, we're lucky.\r\n\r\nThe first and most difficult part of learning Sphinx is it's installation routine. Numerous times I have failed compiling Sphinx on my Macbook and also on CentOS servers. That made me stayed away too far from it. So after a few Googling sessions, I thought it was time to tame the beast. First step was to compile Sphinx on my Macbook.\r\n\r\nWhat you're gonna need are:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Sphinx source code provided <a href=\"http://sphinxsearch.com/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

However, after careful redesigning andÂ re-tinkering, it turns out to be one of the most flexible and yet light fulltext search engine available today.Â There are others but nothing as light, fast and sleek as Sphinx. The cold truth is that Sphinx is supporting SQL based databases as far as I know. Since Urbanesia is already using MySQL as our backend, we're lucky.</p>\n\n<p>The first and most difficult part of learning Sphinx is it's installation routine. Numerous times I have failed compiling Sphinx on my Macbook and also on CentOS servers. That made me stayed away too far from it.

The trip was 2 days 1 night but the experience I absorbed was well beyond the quantity. The theme for the Bancakan event was Wordpresspreneur. Startups and entrepreneurs as speakers came from Bandung and in and around Jogja. The lineup was very enlightening to say the least :)\r\n\r\nFrom Jakarta, I went with Sagad (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/sagad\" target=\"_blank\">@sagad</a>) and Ollie (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/salsabeela\" target=\"_blank\">@salsabeela</a>) by train. We arrived at 6 AM Friday and was welcomed by Fachry (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/fachrybafadal\" target=\"_blank\">@fachrybafadal</a>). Stayed at Hotel Maharani with the gang from Bandung which are Agus (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/agoes82\" target=\"_blank\">@agoes82</a>) of <a href=\"http://www.gantibaju.com\" target=\"_blank\">GantiBaju.com</a>, Anggi (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/icreativelabs\" target=\"_blank\">@icreativelabs</a>), Valent of WordcampID (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/valentmustamin\" target=\"_blank\">@ValentMustamin</a>) and Bima.\r\n\r\nIt so happens that our hotel's location is supposedly where most tourists stayed in Jogja but due to the natural disaster of Merapi, the area was quiet and only saw a couple of tourists coming from overseas. Let's all pray that this condition is temporary, Jogja has shown the world how great they were handling crisis. They unite as one and they recover as one, hopefully this sets an example for all of us that by uniting we are stronger than ever before when we need to right now.\r\n\r\nAs a nation with a multitude of diversity, we are rich in creativity and innovation. This is not a theory, the speakers at Bancakan showed how well they use this opportunity to their benefit. Make it great, make it free and make premiums. It sells, the top earners in Wordpress theming are Indonesians. Now we can see how great a nation we are!\r\n\r\nI was up to present about <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lokalid\" target=\"_blank\">@lokalID</a>. People ask me how it's gonna protect the ecosystem, simply by uniting that's enough, LokalID is a first step, the next steps are entirely in the community discretion. Plant the idea in each of our minds that we are the biggest Internet market by traffic and that's only 10% of the population. Everyone from in and around the world are of course eyeing their interest to our market, each one of you is the owner of your own startups, make that count big or small. LokalID is non-profit and non-commercial, LokalID is not just me or just you, it's the whole ecosystem, a community of startups from Indonesia uniting as one and support one another. Make that a reality with execution, let's make Indonesia a nation deservedly as innovators, we are great, get used to it!\r\n<div id=\"__ss_5902718\" style=\"width: 425px;\"><object id=\"__sse5902718\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=lokal-id-101125043338-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=lokal-id-alpha&amp;userName=tistaharahap\" /><param name=\"name\" value=\"__sse5902718\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed id=\"__sse5902718\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=lokal-id-101125043338-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=lokal-id-alpha&amp;userName=tistaharahap\" name=\"__sse5902718\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></div>\r\nAfter the event, exactly like a few months ago, we went to Gudeg Batas Kota to eat Gudeg, what else lol. I ate Gudeg 4 times that day and had no regrets! Not everyday I got the chance to enjoy it and wasn't missing the opportunity :) We were exhausted that night and the gang from Jakarta parted early including me to rest. After a while, Agus and the Bandung gang retired to the hotel. All the guys took turn to shower because once we're all done, access to the bathroom was restricted until morning time :p\r\n\r\nAll the guys were already asleep when me and Agus continued our afternoon conversation about Git and what it can do for you. So I followed a tutorial by him, as with any versioning system, it helped a lot with collaborating source codes, it's back to the coders to discipline themselves with the codes and have a firm grasp of the versioning system used. Anyways the conversation grew longer while we were exploring ideas and practical implementations of them, I surrendered that night, was very tired.\r\n\r\nThe next day, it was full of laughters, jokes, optimisms and geekness :p Fachry and Didiet (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/lynxluna\" target=\"_blank\">@lynxluna</a>) joined us and we went around Malioboro to \"accompany\" Ollie with her shopping intentions. Well you know what, it turns out that Ollie was accompanying the boys shopping instead lol. We stopped at 2 things, FOOD and souvenirs. Where else can you eat such crispy and tender Lumpia than in Jogja? Here's a video of a new startup we all are joking about.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[vsw id=\"XIqqJgED3oE\" source=\"youtube\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" autoplay=\"no\"]</p>\r\nWhen night falls, we were determined to eat Sate Kambing Klathak. It was a long drive from our hotel to Bantul. We waited for at least an hour for the Klathak to come. Each portion only have 2 sticks and it was a pain waiting that long so when the first batch of portions came, we ordered another round lol. I must tell you that you haven't ate any Sate Kambing until you taste a Klathak. You'd forget the long wait and the overly expensive taxi ride for a taste of Klathak!\r\n\r\nSo anyways, we went to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/onebitmedia\" target=\"_blank\">@OneBitMedia</a> afterwards and another video was recorded about Ollie and The Cat. Watch it below:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[vsw id=\"9HyyAHefdEU\" source=\"youtube\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" autoplay=\"no\"]</p>\r\nAfter a full night of Jogja experience, we went back to the hotel to rest. Our train was leaving early in the morning. In the morning, we hurried up and went to train station altogether. Sadly for Agus and Anggi, they refused to bring GantiBotol's premier product which forces Agus to change his clothing to compensate for the hot air :p We met with Mas Irwan (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/irwankarta\" target=\"_blank\">@IrwanKarta</a>), one of the organizing committee of Bancakan while we were there. Yeah he was going to Oslo with the Pramex train, yeay Jogja :)\r\n\r\nWhen we boarded the train I told Sagad and Ollie how boring 8 hours can be so why not make a startup from zero and deliver an alpha before arriving at Gambir. And so we did! We brainstormed a concept based on an earlier concept Ollie and me were talking about earlier and Sagad guided us with a <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/gHowFy\" target=\"_blank\">Business Model Canvas</a>. I'm sure any startup would want to know about. Either creating a startup or a feature, I'm sure it'll be useful.\r\n\r\nOllie designed the whole look and feel and she coded everything for me to implement it. It's amazing how passion fueled 8 hours of our lives on that trip. We couldn't care less about anything and were very focused in what we are doing at the moment. It's not just about the product nor the startup, it's about each one of us sharing the same passion and the same purpose. The very foundation of LokalID. We proved to ourselves that all 3 of us were from different startups and yet we spawned another one only in 8 hours. It's about perspective, guts and being ourselves. We are who we are, GEEKS! As Didiet say it, THAT'S A COMPLIMENT!\r\n\r\nEvery one of us is able to achieve more from your current selves right now! We deservedly have the rights and obligations to be on the top of the food chain, we need an ecosystem supporting this idea and each one of you counts. Make yourself significant and appreciated as an Indonesian Startup, we all deserve it, we are a great nation and most definitely, YOU ARE GREAT!\r\n\r\nPS: We finished the #GOATChallenge before reaching Gambir while the train was stopping at Jatinegara station.

LokalID adalah gagasan/ide yang bertujuan untuk memperkuat, melindungi dan meningkatkan nilai serta identitas ekosistem<em> </em>startup di Indonesia.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Berawal dari pembicaraan di sela-sela SparxUp kurang lebih 1 bulan yang lalu, saya sendiri dan Sanny Gaddafi (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/sagad\" target=\"_blank\">@Sagad</a>) sedang membahas mengenai berbagai perkembangan startup di Indonesia. Indonesia adalah negara yang unik karena kita terdiri dari berbagai jenis perbedaan tapi dipersatukan oleh satu kesamaan yaitu Indonesia itu sendiri. Begitu juga dengan startup, tidak sedikit startup yang berkompetisi di SparxUp dan berasal dari seluruh Indonesia. Inilah yang membuat ekosistem startup begitu kaya, ada begitu banyak kreativitas dan inovasi yang berasal dari tiap-tiap startup.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Nyatanya ternyata segudang ide saja tidak cukup untuk membawa startup lokal untuk mengisi posisi Top 5 situs yang paling dikunjungi di Indonesia menurut <a href=\"http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/ID\" target=\"_blank\">Alexa</a>. Jika dianalisa lebih mendalam lagi menggunakan Google Trends, ada statistik yang menggelikan mengenai traffic dari Indonesia menuju <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends?q=facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> dan <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends?q=google.com&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>. Baik dalam Top Country maupun Top City, Indonesia bukan berada di peringkat 1 tapi untuk bahasa yang paling digunakan di kedua situs tersebut, Bahasa Indonesia menempati peringkat 1. Analisa kotor menunjukkan bahwa orang Indonesia dimanapun dia berada menggunakan Bahasa Indonesia untuk mengakses Facebook dan Google, dengan begitu orang Indonesia merajai penggunaan kedua situs tersebut di seluruh dunia.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Jika anda iseng-iseng menggunakan Google Trends untuk melihat statistik situs-situs lain, saya jamin anda akan terkejut melihat begitu besar traffic Indonesia. Di <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends?q=blogger.com\" target=\"_blank\">Blogger.com</a> dan <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends?q=wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wordpress.com</a>, Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 di semua lini, pembuktian bahwa blog di Indonesia sangat kaya! Semoga statistik dari Google Trends akurat karena dari semua kota di Indonesia, Jakarta adalah kota yang paling banyak menyumbangkan traffic, bisa dibayangkan jika kota-kota lain di Indonesia pada waktunya nanti memiliki kemudahan akses Internet seperti di Jakarta, traffic Internet tentunya akan meledak.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kedua paragraf sebelumnya menjelaskan betapa besar aktivitas internet di Indonesia, paragraf ini ingin menunjukkan bahwa saat ini hanya dengan <a href=\"http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats3.htm#asia\" target=\"_blank\">penetrasi internet di Indonesia sebesar 12,3%</a>, populasi internet Indonesia telah berhasil menjadi traffic leader di berbagai situs global. Saya rasa sangat beralasan untuk mengatakan bahwa inilah nilai dasar dari semua startup di Indonesia.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kembali ke paragraf pertama bahwa lokalID adalah sebuah gagasan/ide yang pada dasarnya hanya memiliki potensi saja. Startup di Indonesia adalah pelaku-pelaku yang dapat merealisasikan lokalID. Oleh karena itu lokalID adalah milik semua startup (komunitas). Sampai kapanpun, lokalID bersifat non-profit dan non-commercial.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Saat ini saya ingin mengajak teman-teman semua untuk bergabung menjadi satu melalui sebuah langkah pertama untuk membawa perubahan. Dengan menggunakan lokalID, ada 3 hal yang secara langsung menjadi benefit bagi tiap-tiap startup yang bersatu yaitu Single Sign-On, Traffic Profiling dan Marketing Platform.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Single Sign-On</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Seperti layaknya Facebook maupun Twitter Connect, lokalID memberikan kemudahan bagi user untuk hanya menggunakan 1 identitas pada saat mendaftarkan diri di tiap-tiap situs. Tidak ada yang baru dengan konsep ini.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Traffic Profiling</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Andaikata startup anda memiliki 50 juta Pageviews/bulan dengan member sebanyak 100.000 orang. Jika setiap member rata-rata mengakses sebanyak 20 visit/bulan maka akan menghasilkan 2 juta Pageviews/bulan. Apa jadinya dengan defisit 48 juta Pageviews/bulan? Jika dari defisit tersebut katakan ada 30% (14,4 juta) pageviews yang merupakan lokalID member maka situs anda akan mendapatkan tambahan informasi yang mencakup demografi (<strong>anonim</strong>) dari page views tersebut.

LokalID adalah gagasan/ide yang bertujuan untuk memperkuat, melindungi dan meningkatkan nilai serta identitas ekosistem<em> </em>startup di Indonesia.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Berawal dari pembicaraan di sela-sela SparxUp kurang lebih 1 bulan yang lalu, saya sendiri dan Sanny Gaddafi (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/sagad\" target=\"_blank\">@Sagad</a>) sedang membahas mengenai berbagai perkembangan startup di Indonesia. Indonesia adalah negara yang unik karena kita terdiri dari berbagai jenis perbedaan tapi dipersatukan oleh satu kesamaan yaitu Indonesia itu sendiri. Begitu juga dengan startup, tidak sedikit startup yang berkompetisi di SparxUp dan berasal dari seluruh Indonesia. Inilah yang membuat ekosistem startup begitu kaya, ada begitu banyak kreativitas dan inovasi yang berasal dari tiap-tiap startup.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Nyatanya ternyata segudang ide saja tidak cukup untuk membawa startup lokal untuk mengisi posisi Top 5 situs yang paling dikunjungi di Indonesia menurut <a href=\"http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/ID\" target=\"_blank\">Alexa</a>. Jika dianalisa lebih mendalam lagi menggunakan Google Trends, ada statistik yang menggelikan mengenai traffic dari Indonesia menuju <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends?q=facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> dan <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends?q=google.com&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>. Baik dalam Top Country maupun Top City, Indonesia bukan berada di peringkat 1 tapi untuk bahasa yang paling digunakan di kedua situs tersebut, Bahasa Indonesia menempati peringkat 1. Analisa kotor menunjukkan bahwa orang Indonesia dimanapun dia berada menggunakan Bahasa Indonesia untuk mengakses Facebook dan Google, dengan begitu orang Indonesia merajai penggunaan kedua situs tersebut di seluruh dunia.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Jika anda iseng-iseng menggunakan Google Trends untuk melihat statistik situs-situs lain, saya jamin anda akan terkejut melihat begitu besar traffic Indonesia. Di <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends?q=blogger.com\" target=\"_blank\">Blogger.com</a> dan <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends?q=wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wordpress.com</a>, Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 di semua lini, pembuktian bahwa blog di Indonesia sangat kaya! Semoga statistik dari Google Trends akurat karena dari semua kota di Indonesia, Jakarta adalah kota yang paling banyak menyumbangkan traffic, bisa dibayangkan jika kota-kota lain di Indonesia pada waktunya nanti memiliki kemudahan akses Internet seperti di Jakarta, traffic Internet tentunya akan meledak.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kedua paragraf sebelumnya menjelaskan betapa besar aktivitas internet di Indonesia, paragraf ini ingin menunjukkan bahwa saat ini hanya dengan <a href=\"http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats3.htm#asia\" target=\"_blank\">penetrasi internet di Indonesia sebesar 12,3%</a>, populasi internet Indonesia telah berhasil menjadi traffic leader di berbagai situs global. Saya rasa sangat beralasan untuk mengatakan bahwa inilah nilai dasar dari semua startup di Indonesia.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kembali ke paragraf pertama bahwa lokalID adalah sebuah gagasan/ide yang pada dasarnya hanya memiliki potensi saja. Startup di Indonesia adalah pelaku-pelaku yang dapat merealisasikan lokalID. Oleh karena itu lokalID adalah milik semua startup (komunitas). Sampai kapanpun, lokalID bersifat non-profit dan non-commercial.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Saat ini saya ingin mengajak teman-teman semua untuk bergabung menjadi satu melalui sebuah langkah pertama untuk membawa perubahan. Dengan menggunakan lokalID, ada 3 hal yang secara langsung menjadi benefit bagi tiap-tiap startup yang bersatu yaitu Single Sign-On, Traffic Profiling dan Marketing Platform.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Single Sign-On</strong></p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Seperti layaknya Facebook maupun Twitter Connect, lokalID memberikan kemudahan bagi user untuk hanya menggunakan 1 identitas pada saat mendaftarkan diri di tiap-tiap situs. Tidak ada yang baru dengan konsep ini.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Traffic Profiling</strong></p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Andaikata startup anda memiliki 50 juta Pageviews/bulan dengan member sebanyak 100.000 orang. Jika setiap member rata-rata mengakses sebanyak 20 visit/bulan maka akan menghasilkan 2 juta Pageviews/bulan. Apa jadinya dengan defisit 48 juta Pageviews/bulan? Jika dari defisit tersebut katakan ada 30% (14,4 juta) pageviews yang merupakan lokalID member maka situs anda akan mendapatkan tambahan informasi yang mencakup demografi (<strong>anonim</strong>) dari page views tersebut. Tidak muluk-muluk tapi yang jelas, anda dapat menggunakan informasi untuk kepentingan situs anda. Mulai dari monetization, user behaviour study sampai ads placement, informasi tersebut pasti akan memberikan benefit, lokalID memberikan data, startup anda yang mengolah menjadi informasi.</p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Marketing Platform</strong></p>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sebagai Marketing Platform, batasannya adalah kreativitas. Hal yang paling mudah dilakukan adalah sebagai berikut:</p>\n\n<blockquote style=\"text-align: left;\">Batista Harahap telah memberikan komentar mengenai Bancakan 7th Meetup di Urbanesia</blockquote>  \n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Stream diatas adalah sebuah record dari aktivitas Batista Harahap di Urbanesia yang disimpan di database lokalID.

The vitamin for the night are no other than towers and towers of Bali Hai beer at <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/g99wiC\" target=\"_blank\">Bremer Kemang</a>. Quite a night to wrap off a week full of prograsm :)\r\n\r\nIt all began with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/andreasfendri\">@AndreasFendri</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ridhimahendra\">@RidhiMahendra</a> calling up to hang out just before upcoming holidays. Call it the last beer night of 2010 for the pack :) It so happens <a href=\"http://twitter.com/chazzuka\" target=\"_blank\">@Chazzuka</a> is in town and together with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/_stevenp_\" target=\"_blank\">@_stevenp_</a> and Jinz.

Well actually I poured first for him but he rejected my offering because of the bubbles lol. So after we all poured ourselves, the conversation started. Finally, I met Chazzuka (Ariel), this guy is one of a kind. His employer is very lucky to have him on board I might add.\r\n\r\nFor the earlier part of the night, I was involved in a very engaging debate about optimizing for performance a.k.a speed! Exactly what Urbanesia is on to right now. Learning from Chazzuka's experience in optimizing Tokobagus' backend, Urbanesia is on track!

I just had one of the geekiest night just a few hours ago. Not in front of a laptop I might add, it's one of those days when a few geeks gather to talk about geekness. The vitamin for the night are no other than towers and towers of Bali Hai beer at <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/g99wiC\" target=\"_blank\">Bremer Kemang</a>. Quite a night to wrap off a week full of prograsm :)</p>\n\n<p>It all began with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/andreasfendri\">@AndreasFendri</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ridhimahendra\">@RidhiMahendra</a> calling up to hang out just before upcoming holidays. Call it the last beer night of 2010 for the pack :) It so happens <a href=\"http://twitter.com/chazzuka\" target=\"_blank\">@Chazzuka</a> is in town and together with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/_stevenp_\" target=\"_blank\">@<em>stevenp</em></a> and Jinz. Me and Andre were late, we got caught up in Pasaraya to get something to eat first before the craziness starts :p</p>\n\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_569\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\" caption=\"Behold the first tower of many\"]<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101218_204907.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-569\" title=\"Behold the first tower of many\" src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101218_204907-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Behold the first tower of many\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>[/caption]</p>\n\n<p>The first tower was ready for some pouring and Andre poured first. Well actually I poured first for him but he rejected my offering because of the bubbles lol. So after we all poured ourselves, the conversation started. Finally, I met Chazzuka (Ariel), this guy is one of a kind. His employer is very lucky to have him on board I might add.</p>\n\n<p>For the earlier part of the night, I was involved in a very engaging debate about optimizing for performance a.k.a speed! Exactly what Urbanesia is on to right now. Learning from Chazzuka's experience in optimizing Tokobagus' backend, Urbanesia is on track!

Gw merasa gw seperti low life dan kurang ajar banget padahal udah berulang kali gw nerima pelajaran kalo gw itu ga bisa mengandalkan kekuatan sendiri. Tapi gw merubah perspektif gw, gw ga ngelakuin itu semua untuk gw pribadi tapi lebih banyak untuk kepentingan bersama. Fokus gw adalah menjadi contoh untuk yang lain. Firman Tuhan kemaren bilangnya:\r\n<blockquote>Roma 12:3\r\n<em>Berdasarkan kasih karunia yang dianugerahkan kepadaku, aku berkata kepada setiap orang di antara kamu: Janganlah kamu memikirkan hal-hal yang lebih tinggi dari pada yang patut kamu pikirkan, tetapi hendaklah kamu berpikir begitu rupa, sehingga kamu <strong>menguasai diri menurut ukuran iman</strong>, yang dikaruniakan Allah kepada kamu masing-masing.</em>\r\n\r\nRoma 12:8\r\n<em>jika karunia untuk menasihati, baiklah kita menasihati. Siapa yang <strong>membagi-bagikan</strong> sesuatu, hendaklah ia melakukannya dengan hati yang ikhlas; siapa yang memberi pimpinan, hendaklah ia melakukannya dengan rajin; siapa yang menunjukkan kemurahan, hendaklah ia <strong>melakukannya dengan sukacita</strong>. </em></blockquote>\r\nJadi ternyata yang gw lakukan selamat 4 bulan ga ke Gereja sesuai dengan apa yang Dia mau. Padahal kalo gw berdoa itu biasanya hanya sebelum makan dan pada saat mengucap syukur. Firman diatas konfirmasi gw dengan hati yang tulus, Roh Kudus ada disitu, akhirnya semua yang kita lakuin refleksi dari keberadaan Roh Kudus di dalam hati.\r\n\r\nGw tetep bandel Mel, gw suka minum-minum, isengin orang, makanin makan siang orang lain dan lain-lain, tapi gw belajar J tidak menilai kita hanya dari perbuatan kita, Dia lebih mementingkan hati kita karena disitulah tempat J berada. Dengan adanya J di dalam hati, ada efek samping yang ga bisa ditolak: KASIH.\r\n\r\nItu prinsip dasar yang gw jalani, dengan kasih, gw jadi lebih suka memberi dan membagi. Gw ga muluk-muluk seperti perpuluhan ato persembahan, ga mesti dalam bentuk seperti itu tapi lebih ke bentuk yg intangible yang ga bisa dipegang atau diliat tapi bisa dirasakan.\r\n\r\nOleh karena itu, gw bilang sama diri gw sendiri, dengan gw tetap solo, gw ga bisa membagikan kasih gw dan gw ga merasa hidup. Andaikata gw duet, kebayang ga sih kasih yang bisa dibagi sebesar apa? Itu yang akan jadi kekuatan dan pegangan untuk ngelewatin suka dan duka di hidup kita masing-masing.\r\n\r\nGw pernah bilang di post gw sebelumnya, sedikit love saja menginspirasi gw untuk ngelakuin banyak hal karena memang begitu adanya. Crush ini ke elo membuat diri gw sendiri mempunyai harapan dan dengan modal itu gw melepaskan kreativitas di dalam diri gw sendiri. Setelah bikin website tentang elo semalem, gw malah terinspirasi untuk projek startup gw selanjutnya. Semuanya karena kasih.\r\n\r\nMel jangan pikir gw ngomong semua ini karena karir gw udah dalam posisi enak, gw mulai semua dari 0. Gw ngelewatin banyak tantangan dan olok-olok dari keluarga untuk sampai ke gw yang sekarang ini.

It is not without a great deal of struggle, that is a definition of me.\r\n\r\nLooking back to 1996, I had my first Yahoo account. It was then Geocities.com, a website providing free website service for just about anyone interested. Back in the days, offering something free on the Internet is considered a lunatic. Well over the years, the web proved skeptics wrong I suppose. Look at the big 4: Facebook, Google, Twitter and Yahoo, they're the very definition of success.\r\n\r\nNowadays, monetizing the Internet is getting smarter and smarter everyday. Directly or indirectly, startups create revenue channels. Either by ads or other means, the web has evolved to something bigger than anything we've come to expect. Indonesia is still an infant compared to other countries but all eyes are on us now. With only a penetration of just above 10%, we have managed to be the top users of any best seller website in the world.\r\n\r\nWhile that's proof of how big and engaging the Indonesian market, still the traffic is monetized outside of Indonesia. We are still a nation of consumers with an amazing consumptive behavior especially in big cities like Jakarta.Â I had college friends from Singapore and Brunei telling me how bored they are with their own countries because of their nation's limited quantity in people. They've been through every corner of their country and to think or create something new to do is just not happening.\r\n\r\nHere in Indonesia, we are blessed with an abundance of everything. From people, cars, bikes to culture, we are rich! The sad thing is that it is still not enough (for now) to trigger creativity that can lead to innovation. I'm just saying this generally because every day I see people with brands everywhere on their bodies and they're like robots. Not that I don't like it but it basically numbs you to think out of the box.\r\n\r\nCompared to the general population, there are so few entrepreneurs and not to mention those whose success level are off the chart, they are a commodity in Indonesia rare and sometimes untouched. I have aÂ habitÂ of choosing the path that is not easy. It's not something I intended but that's just me. From something new and most likely difficult to comprehend at the time, I feel the challenge to understand at minimum. Whether I can capitalize on it is another story. Like an investment, values grow over time.\r\n\r\nI've been lucky enough to be able to do whatever it is I wanna do. Appreciation is due to friends and family for their never ending patience of seeing me do things they can't understand at the time. The most important lesson is that I had the chance to explore myself and therefore knows my own limitation and boundaries. Technically, every one of us have the ability to compete but then it's not all that. I learned that the most important part of being technical is to brand it into yourself and to others.\r\n\r\nMy first Hello World was in a very early age, I was at my 2nd or 3rd grade in elementary school where my family bought a new 8088 XT with 5.25\" disks. It was state of the art at the time and I was amazed by it. My dad played Digger and I learned how to play it. Got really excited to understand how sometimes the monitor is monochrome but when you play Digger, the colors appeared.\r\n\r\nBack then books about computers is a rare gem. My dad had 1 and it was a book about Apple BASIC while the computer was a PC. It was in English and I didn't know the language. So I asked to have an English course at Verlin, Pondok Indah which I did. I began to understand bits and pieces from the book. It took me quite a while to produce my own Hello World.\r\n\r\nI started subscribing to the US version of PC Magazine and that was life changing. It opened up a whole new perspective about PCs to me. I am a grassroot learner, I like to learn the basic of everything and after knowing the basics of them all, focus on parts that interest me most. Well in IT, it was programming, I find it amazing with every keystroke you make on your keyboard, you are controlling bits into something humans can comprehend.\r\n\r\nIn Junior and Senior high, I always get 9s on my report card with computers. They taught me BASIC and in elementary school, I already knew and practiced the language although privately. When I was in college, that was a pivotal moment in my programming years. I learned the almighty C. With most of today's popular programming languageÂ derivedÂ from C, I felt at home immediately with PHP and just recently, Java.\r\n\r\nThis year, I had one of my best moment as a programmer. Since I joined Urbanesia, every time me and the team coded, we seem to always find \"prograsm\" moments throughout. Urbanesia is a complex and vast entity. A lot of it was still a sleeping giant. The whole team progressed to become by my personal standard to be one of the best programmers I've every worked with and everytime, the team is thirst and hungry for more. They have shown that nothing can't beat our passion. Our passion spans across a multitude of diverse experiences between us and we managed to work collectively as one entity. You guys rock!\r\n\r\nDuring Urbanesia's v1.0 push to our launch date, the team coded 19.023 lines of codes not including those we were unable to count. Our SVN statistics was like Christmas all over. During the 4,5 weeks of coding, we have generated more than half the codes that Urbanesia Beta has produced. Every single aspect of Urbanesia was refined and optimized to enable to scale. We discovered things we didn't know like this condition:\r\n<pre lang=\"php\">(TRUE == FALSE) = TRUE</pre>\r\nLogically thinking the condition above is absurd but that particular condition stalled a great deal of time with our programming because we have to refactor more codes. Nevertheless, I am proud of what the team has achieved so far. We gained so much in 2010 that it is my hopes and expectations that in 2011, it's time for Urbanesia to run like never before. The marketing team both online and offline are already supercharged for 2011. This December was as I said, a pivotal moment. Urbanesia as a team confided with each other, there is an entrepreneurial atmosphere in each of the person involved, we pushed ourselves to the limit only to find that we don't have any limits, our minds and imaginations are our drive.\r\n\r\nWe agreed on 1 motto for 2011:\r\n<blockquote><strong>DON'T THINK, JUST DO!</strong></blockquote>\r\nLet's welcome 2011 with an attitude the world's Internet industry and definitely Indonesian's Internet industry have never seen before. We are agents of change and startups are vessels. Bear in mind, every startup experiences the same obstacles, if we can collaborate, why not? We are in the business of passion, nothing can beat our passion!\r\n\r\nSo to wrap things up, it's been a great year all round. I am thankful for every bits of blessings I have received this year, hopefully everything I am and what I have given can inspire more people to know for themselves thatÂ <strong>YOU ARE YOUR OWN STARTUP</strong>.","html":"<p>It is now the 28th day of December 2010, rounding up to be one of the most inspiring year I have had so far.

This week we discovered that although we have completely revamped our codes to hack CI to use MongoDB as its session storage instead of MySQL, we found that Memcache is the bottleneck. When I woke up today, I was devastated to know that it took at minimum 5.7 seconds to load any of our business profiles.\r\n\r\nSo I went hunting for the source of this irritating loading time. The Memcache problem was because our Sofvia server is at its limit, we've pushed the CPU utilization to her max and Memcache is simply not getting enough CPU Power. The main cause is putting 2 Memcache instances in Sofvia which in turn made CPU utilizations soar. When Memcache was out of CPU resource, the server was on an endless loop with load averages sky rocketing to &gt; 100. Reference is <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/dNj60F\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nSo we moved Memcache to another server and increased PHP's Memcache module chunk size to 32 MB by adding this line to php.ini:\r\n<pre lang=\"php\">memcache.chunk_size = 32768</pre>\r\nI was reluctant at first to install APC because I wanted to test our v1 codes against real world conditions. Sufficient to say, we did all the optimization we could in terms of codes. It is time to optimize it in another way. So today I installed APC, for its performance gain, I have to say the installation routine was too easy to be true lol.\r\n\r\nThe Memcache server is moved to another server so Sofvia had a lot of unused memories. Before installing APC, the free memory was ~10Gigs. APC is easy to install but cryptic with its configuration, I read a lot of references before actually enabling APC and do a little trial and error with it. The configuration for APC is:\r\n<pre lang=\"php\">extension=apc.so\r\napc.enabled=1\r\napc.shm_segments=1\r\napc.optimization=1\r\napc.shm_size=1G\r\napc.ttl=7200\r\napc.user_ttl=7200\r\napc.num_files_hint=1024\r\napc.mmap_file_mask=/tmp/apc.XXXXXX</pre>\r\nYou might have guessed why apc.stat is not zeroed out. Just for today, I don't want to refactor any codes while configuring APC, as is will have to do fine. When I set apc.stat = 0, Urbanesia went crazy because CI by default used relative paths which is acceptable because of its general purpose design. With apc.stat = 1, APC will check for changes with the file every time a request is made.\r\n\r\nNow all happy and grinning in front of my Macbook when I restarted Apache only to find that the total execution time was lowered only to ~4.8 seconds. Not acceptable at all! So I went ahead to Xdebug the problems. Looking from the result, it was supposed to be smooth sails with functions ran under 100ms. If I total the whole execution time of each functions, it was not even close to 4.8 seconds.\r\n\r\nSo I surrendered a few restrictions for today, this must have something to do with bad codes and or slow response time either from Memcache, MongoDB, MySQL or Sphinx. All and all, I remembered turning on pageviews log and being confidence that by using MongoDB as its backend, it wouldn't slow things down, well at least not significantly. I was wrong :(\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the culprit is MongoDB. The daemon was not in Sofvia, it was in Davinci. So requests to MongoDB was at our network's mercy. Now I can conclude that it was not our network's performance, okay maybe it was something to do with the network cables but from a software point of view, it was top notch. Yes we're gonna upgrade the cables :)\r\n\r\nI turned off logging from our codes breaking today's restriction :( The execution time went from ~4.8 seconds to a mere ~0.7 seconds. So for now performance is gained once again by disabling the logs. Checking the MongoDB collection, we had over than 5 millions rows worth of logs. Xdebug complained about our CI driver's Get method for MongoDB. I hope this will be a CI driver problem because for its worth, MongoDB is a performance gainer almost every time against MySQL.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is, our CI sessions collections had more rows and performance was not affected at all, we used the same CI driver too.\r\n\r\nSo for anyone out there reading this blog post, would love to have your comments about MongoDB and CI.

Been wanting to write a blog post all day but didn't really got the time until now. This will be the 3rd night in December when insomnia is becoming a habit. Anyways, I wanted to write but I wanna do it \"<em>spur of the moment</em>\" style. So this blog post will talk about anything that pops up in my mind, bear with me :p\r\n\r\nFirst topic will be <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">positivity</span>. Man this December is full of it! How can you be negative when the exact same amount of energy can make you feel alive even more than the general population is feeling? Living in Jakarta, negativity is everywhere. From the moment you walked out off your homes then voila, welcome to the jungle. I see it as opportunities! So many things we can make right of.\r\n\r\nTraffic jams will surely be the best seller for negativities in Jakarta would it? The cool thing is <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/hOiwK9\" target=\"_blank\">LewatMana.com</a> lives and breathes from it and won a <a href=\"http://www.sparxup.com\" target=\"_blank\">SparxUp</a> award while they're at it. Urbanesia's office is the location of one of their traffic cameras I might add. In Jakarta, we are blessed with more problems than solutions so it is my believe that startups will flourish here! The recentÂ acquisitionÂ of <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/gdKycG\" target=\"_blank\">Koprol</a> by <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/fDcau3\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo</a> is prove that building one is NOT a long shot.\r\n\r\nAnother topic just crossed my mind and that's <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">perspective</span>. I can't keep count of how many times I said the word without bringing myself to boredom because I tell you, perspective is poison and also honey :p It will be radioactive when you focus extremely only with a single perspective but it will be a lifesaver when you have lots of it. After all, <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/fDiks5\" target=\"_blank\">@liamtanu</a> Co-Founder of <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/fWnuuf\" target=\"_blank\">Tokopedia</a> always say \"<em>Luck is when Opportunity meets Preparation</em>\".\r\n\r\nWhy I connect the dots between perspective and luck is because coming back to the first topic of positivity, running and building a startup needs lots of positivity and perspective with luck inclusive! Before joining <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/esOEup\" target=\"_blank\">Urbanesia</a>, I was working in <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/eD8iMF\" target=\"_blank\">Hotel Mulia Senayan</a> as a Web Developer and then ran a small company called <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/f3qZNZ\" target=\"_blank\">Mediafusion</a>. I had a lot of learning moments with both of them.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still at Hotel Mulia Senayan, I discovered the awesomeness of 3D Panoramas. I learned how to take pictures and stitch them together which in turns create a beautiful 3D Panorama. I was lucky that although a Web Developer, I was stationed at the Art &amp; Printshop Department and suffice to say, creativity and technical drive is never ending over there. Worked with good friends and one of the best people I've ever had the chance to know.\r\n\r\nThat particular 3D Panorama opened up a new sense of excitement for me. I learned something new and I succeeded in making it happen for myself. There were no one in Indonesia doing it at the time as to my knowledge. So with 3D Panoramas in hand, I jumpstarted a small company called Mediafusion.\r\n\r\nWe were chasing a project at <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/hd6GNW\" target=\"_blank\">Taman Mini Indonesia Indah</a> and wanting to impress them, I shot a few landmarks in 3D Panorama. It was all done with a pocket camera and a slightly modified tripod. For each landmarks, I had to make ~360 pictures because the lens is not wide enough *sigh*. The tripod is not specifically made for 3D Panorama so the lens wasn't positioned exactly at its nodal point but I thought it was enough to show a general idea of what we can do.Â Sadly, we didn't get the project but went on to opened up more opportunities especially for my partner.\r\n\r\nYou'll be wondering what that story has to say about my previous paragraph of connecting the dots. As I quoted earlier about the definition of luck, I grew more confident inside of me that nothing is impossible, it's either you know something or you don't. When you know it, what's stopping you from being the next rockstar? My point is, I never let down myself by saying that my effort is useless. Because of that particular moment with 3D Panoramas, Urbanesia now join the ranks of only 4 other photographers in Indonesia able to do such thing. You can see it <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/eXVQIk\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Note:</span> I'm not a photographer, I'm a geek.\r\n\r\nNow you'll see why Google does not trash their products, they recycle it and so did I. Ideas are the basics of creativity leading to innovation, don't waste them! In Urbanesia, now we have more whiteboards than we could ever dreamed of. You can write anything anywhere at the office. Most of them that are writable are already full with people writing about the next big thing in Urbanesia or even funny anecdotes.

I feel I'm in the right place and time where I am today. Got to spend countless hours doing something I love and I'm just one of the 16 other similar people in Urbanesia. <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/dHgwtM\" target=\"_blank\">Selina Limman</a>, I owe you a big thanks!

Now tell me how to decode this topic? If you ask me, I don't know where to start. All I know is this topic is exactly why Urbanesia as a team has progressed this far. I talked about this oftenly with <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/gegDfy\" target=\"_blank\">@RidhiMahendra</a> over countless beer bottles. You don't learn this kinda thing, you experience it and leverage from it. Like beer bottles, we found out that our limit for 1 night is 3 bottles/pax lol.\r\n\r\n<strong>Personally Professional</strong>\r\n\r\nCommunication is why the IT industry exists. The act of sending and receiving data is what I call communication. Talking to each other is one of them. With talking, your brain encodes and decodes messages sent and received from people you talk to. If you don't do it with the right algorithm and or compression, the data will most likely be lost in translation or in geek terms: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">corrupted</span>.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is there, to figure out the right algorithm for 2 or more ends to communicate. The first thing to do was to experience the whole thing and make an example out of it. That's what we did with 4.5 weeks of endless codings. Let me ask you this, how do you motivate people? I'm answering this simple, just be one of the people you'd want to motivate. We managed to find the best out of all of us and focused the next efforts on that particular areas for each person.\r\n\r\n<strong>Professionally Personal</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is by far the most interesting outcome so far. My friendship with Ridhi goes from high school and our experiences in life are not so different from one another. But now we're also colleagues. It's becoming a challenge from day 1 to really distinguish friendship and professionalÂ decisions. Well this is when opportunity meets preparation A.K.A Luck. Ridhi is an SEO expert, he makes his judgement with data supporting him and with that discipline, it has kept Urbanesia leveled with what our data is showing us.\r\n\r\nImagine applying the last sentence above to your personal life with all your colleagues.

With the right portion and timing of appreciation, one can introduce redefining moments to just about anyone. Passion is never ending, make it real :D","html":"<p>Okay the title says it all. Been wanting to write a blog post all day but didn't really got the time until now. This will be the 3rd night in December when insomnia is becoming a habit. Anyways, I wanted to write but I wanna do it \"<em>spur of the moment</em>\" style. So this blog post will talk about anything that pops up in my mind, bear with me :p</p>\n\n<p>First topic will be <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">positivity</span>. Man this December is full of it! How can you be negative when the exact same amount of energy can make you feel alive even more than the general population is feeling? Living in Jakarta, negativity is everywhere. From the moment you walked out off your homes then voila, welcome to the jungle. I see it as opportunities! So many things we can make right of.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic jams will surely be the best seller for negativities in Jakarta would it? The cool thing is <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/hOiwK9\" target=\"_blank\">LewatMana.com</a> lives and breathes from it and won a <a href=\"http://www.sparxup.com\" target=\"_blank\">SparxUp</a> award while they're at it. Urbanesia's office is the location of one of their traffic cameras I might add. In Jakarta, we are blessed with more problems than solutions so it is my believe that startups will flourish here! The recentÂ acquisitionÂ of <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/gdKycG\" target=\"_blank\">Koprol</a> by <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/fDcau3\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo</a> is prove that building one is NOT a long shot.</p>\n\n<p>Another topic just crossed my mind and that's <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">perspective</span>. I can't keep count of how many times I said the word without bringing myself to boredom because I tell you, perspective is poison and also honey :p It will be radioactive when you focus extremely only with a single perspective but it will be a lifesaver when you have lots of it. After all, <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/fDiks5\" target=\"_blank\">@liamtanu</a> Co-Founder of <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/fWnuuf\" target=\"_blank\">Tokopedia</a> always say \"<em>Luck is when Opportunity meets Preparation</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>Why I connect the dots between perspective and luck is because coming back to the first topic of positivity, running and building a startup needs lots of positivity and perspective with luck inclusive! Before joining <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/esOEup\" target=\"_blank\">Urbanesia</a>, I was working in <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/eD8iMF\" target=\"_blank\">Hotel Mulia Senayan</a> as a Web Developer and then ran a small company called <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/f3qZNZ\" target=\"_blank\">Mediafusion</a>. I had a lot of learning moments with both of them.</p>\n\n<p>While I was still at Hotel Mulia Senayan, I discovered the awesomeness of 3D Panoramas. I learned how to take pictures and stitch them together which in turns create a beautiful 3D Panorama. I was lucky that although a Web Developer, I was stationed at the Art &amp; Printshop Department and suffice to say, creativity and technical drive is never ending over there. Worked with good friends and one of the best people I've ever had the chance to know.</p>\n\n<p>That particular 3D Panorama opened up a new sense of excitement for me. I learned something new and I succeeded in making it happen for myself. There were no one in Indonesia doing it at the time as to my knowledge. So with 3D Panoramas in hand, I jumpstarted a small company called Mediafusion.</p>\n\n<p>We were chasing a project at <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/hd6GNW\" target=\"_blank\">Taman Mini Indonesia Indah</a> and wanting to impress them, I shot a few landmarks in 3D Panorama. It was all done with a pocket camera and a slightly modified tripod. For each landmarks, I had to make ~360 pictures because the lens is not wide enough <em>sigh</em>. The tripod is not specifically made for 3D Panorama so the lens wasn't positioned exactly at its nodal point but I thought it was enough to show a general idea of what we can do.Â Sadly, we didn't get the project but went on to opened up more opportunities especially for my partner.</p>\n\n<p>You'll be wondering what that story has to say about my previous paragraph of connecting the dots. As I quoted earlier about the definition of luck, I grew more confident inside of me that nothing is impossible, it's either you know something or you don't. When you know it, what's stopping you from being the next rockstar? My point is, I never let down myself by saying that my effort is useless. Because of that particular moment with 3D Panoramas, Urbanesia now join the ranks of only 4 other photographers in Indonesia able to do such thing. You can see it <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/eXVQIk\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Note:</span> I'm not a photographer, I'm a geek.</p>\n\n<p>Now you'll see why Google does not trash their products, they recycle it and so did I. Ideas are the basics of creativity leading to innovation, don't waste them! In Urbanesia, now we have more whiteboards than we could ever dreamed of. You can write anything anywhere at the office. Most of them that are writable are already full with people writing about the next big thing in Urbanesia or even funny anecdotes. It is my mission to explore every person in Urbanesia and bring out the best in them: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Themselves</span>.</p>\n\n<p>Wow this spontaneous writing makes me really thankful.

The 24th day of 2011 and it seems that months have passed by just like that. In the span of 24 days that have passed, every single day is cramped with all the aspects of being a startup. Just today, I went from a programmer, a cable crimper, a business partner, a troubleshooter, a mobile app consultant, a colleague to a friend for a friend, all in just one day. Multiply that by 24 and that's exactly what's been going on. The dynamics revolving is mind blowing.\r\n\r\nI can't help to wonder exactly what I'm doing right now is to look back and kinda being nostalgic to myself to figure out how so much energy can be exuded with far less sleep than ever before. Physics defines e (energy) equals m (mass) times c (speed of light) square. There is no indefinite variable there although I have to admit my mass is fluctuating but it is drastically paled to insignificance when multiplied with the square of the speed of light which is 3.6 millions meters/second. NO, the speed of light is a constant and therefore always have the same value while mass is the dynamics.\r\n\r\nWell mass is the variable and this is where energy can be increased or decreased exponentially literally. With Einstein's theory of energy, it's safe to say that without mass, it's just light. The same light currently transporting zillions of gigabit traffic around the world to every connected computers globally. What's best of all, at least for now, light is unlimited and available anywhere in the world. What the world lack is mass.\r\n\r\nThese past months, we've been having a 40% problem in Urbanesia. Our sudden drop of traffic is just weird. Efforts to tackle the drop were taken, from AB testing new designs to optimizing codes to be able to serve faster were done like it's do or die. We found a really troubling fact. Our Google Analytics Javascript code is not loading as expected in most parts of Urbanesia.\r\n\r\nWith the new look, we introduced a new framework for Urbanesia. We hate inline JS and CSS, so we created a framework to parse JS and CSS, minified them and put them in separated files. The Google Analytics loader JS was one of them. We put it at the bottom like any other sane website. Well that was the problem. Most of our visitors' Internet connection was not fast enough to grab the loader file in a way to keep up with their engagement with the website.\r\n\r\nSo with every good programming practice, we refactored the codes. Affectionally, we put the codes up top before closing the HEAD tag and pointed ga.js to load from our CDN. The result is a 40% difference! This is a big lesson for everyone in Urbanesia. With Google Analytics measuring the right numbers of traffic, our approach to enable Urbanesia to scale is now sane again.\r\n\r\nDuring the process, we treated ourselves a new Cloud Server at Biznet and boy that has made another big impact towards our traffic. From the beginning of the new look for Urbanesia, we concentrated our efforts so that our application servers can be migrated to multiple servers instantly. The big roadblock was that we didn't had a good enough API to support this. So we went on to create one of the best API to date for Urbanesia.\r\n\r\nBy having a great API, we managed to localize each parts of Urbanesia to scale with proportion. Optimizing Apache is trivial to be able to handle this many API calls/seconds. Because of Apache's great flexibility, it became its own worst nightmare. Our Apache configuration is hand tuned slowly to cope with the changes. Thank God for nginx!\r\n\r\nOur cloud server is a single core, 1 GB RAM server and it's serving half of Urbanesia's traffic with that little man namely nginx. Nginx as a proxy load balancer is amazing. Just by having 1 nginx, we boosted 300% of our concurrent traffic. With proper caching of static contents, this has been a relieve. Since we now have 2 nginx instances, we have increased our daily traffic to cope with multi Mbps traffic constantly.\r\n\r\nIn parallel, we transitioned Urbanesia from a 100% MySQL oriented website to switch to a 70% portion for MySQL and 30% portion of MongoDB. The problem with MySQL is that it can't keep up with our increasing needs and we don't wanna scale hardware yet. So it's back to the applications we used. By using MongoDB, we put all of our high volumes &amp; low value data in it. The best thing about MongoDB is that it's really fast! The catch is MongoDB uses a lot and i mean a lot of physical memory to be able to do this. Think of of it as MySQL + Memcache on steroids. To keep MongoDB performing like this, we revamped our Database server to cope with MongoDB's need for memory.\r\n\r\nSo as you can see, logically we have separated Urbanesia into partitions. Now we can scale Urbanesia according to the needs of each partitions. A Googler told me that \"<em>Faster loading of pages equals more revenues</em>\". We measure revenue notÂ necessarilyÂ in $$$. Users engagements is one of our metrics. Well the words were proven. We hit a new record this January with users engagements. The total number of reviews as of 24 January 2011 have beaten the best month of 2010 and we still have 7 days to get more reviews.\r\n\r\nOur marketing and development team is moving with right pace both independently and as a big team. This is key to our sudden increase of performance in January 2011. We learned to work it out as a team and makeÂ decisionsÂ based on data collected. We AB Test all of our changes and introduced a heat map. The data we gained was invaluable to our efforts. Because of the nature of Urbanesia being so vast, we couldn't just highlight everything all at once, we needed to move single minded. Reinforcing everything one step at a time.\r\n\r\nThe last 3 months of 2010 were allocated to create a rock solid foundation for 2011 and it worked out like a charm. I'm very proud to say that our team of superheroes are incredible. The dedication and affection towards Urbanesia are not like what you can expect in any other ordinary workplace. Salute to every one of us!\r\n\r\nIn closing, I learned an important lesson with scaling. Scaling is an artwork, nothing is for certain until you get to the point where every destination is mapped and prepped for dynamics. Meaning that anytime, our infrastructure must be ready for changes while maintaining a high level of stability. From a business side, well when you got the software, hardware and human resource right then you just gotten your most invaluable asset: A living and breathing product manifested in all of our work.

For tonight, my iTunes is happily playing songs by Tohpati in his rather old solo album. By the way, from what I've been trying to do the past few weeks, it seems that only when I got home will then writing moments will be abundant for my fingers. Can't seem to do this while at the office.\r\n\r\nSince it's still warm and huggable, the first topic will definitely be about Urbanesia and itsÂ unprecedentedÂ outcome this past few months. Just got home from a long 2 weeks marathon at the office. I must say the last 2 weeks were one of those times when redefining moments just happen without no specific reasonings. My last piece of spontaneous writing noted December 2010 as one of those times and yet it happened again early this year.\r\n\r\nIn a more technical way, all of our preparation to ready Urbanesia for 2011 were making results faster and better than what we expected them to be. Since we are migrating every models we had to retrieve data from our newly crafted API, Sofvia our application server were flooded with a high number of locally inbound HTTP requests. Load averages soar high looking from our Munin graphs.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious reason for this to happen is because we just migrated on of our application server to <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/g8J6a4\" target=\"_blank\">Biznet's Cloud Computing</a> platform. We took a spin with the lowest spec available which is a 1 core, 1 GB RAM, 100 GB SAN Storage and 100 Mbps shared International Bandwidth. Freshly installed CentOS and wiped everything not needed due to the resource constraints. We knew it wouldn't be ideal to make it a full fledged application server so instead we made it to be a full fledged proxy server for our international traffic. Geo targeted DNS with Bind was executed so the local and international is routed accordingly.\r\n\r\nWith the changes above, Googlebots scour our website like never before. Just 18 days after its premier, our stats show that in January 2011, Googlebots downloaded a whooping 217 GB worth of data from our website. The amazing thing is with nginx in our Biznet cloud server, the load average never even touched 1.0. Memory usage was also amazingly lean with no swap space at all. It's great to know all those gigabytes of data is served by a tiny server.\r\n\r\nWith all that traffic, the strain was with Sofvia. We had to optimize a step further.

For tonight, my iTunes is happily playing songs by Tohpati in his rather old solo album. By the way, from what I've been trying to do the past few weeks, it seems that only when I got home will then writing moments will be abundant for my fingers. Can't seem to do this while at the office.</p>\n\n<p>Since it's still warm and huggable, the first topic will definitely be about Urbanesia and itsÂ unprecedentedÂ outcome this past few months. Just got home from a long 2 weeks marathon at the office. I must say the last 2 weeks were one of those times when redefining moments just happen without no specific reasonings. My last piece of spontaneous writing noted December 2010 as one of those times and yet it happened again early this year.</p>\n\n<p>In a more technical way, all of our preparation to ready Urbanesia for 2011 were making results faster and better than what we expected them to be. Since we are migrating every models we had to retrieve data from our newly crafted API, Sofvia our application server were flooded with a high number of locally inbound HTTP requests. Load averages soar high looking from our Munin graphs.</p>\n\n<p>The most obvious reason for this to happen is because we just migrated on of our application server to <a href=\"http://r.bango29.com/g8J6a4\" target=\"_blank\">Biznet's Cloud Computing</a> platform. We took a spin with the lowest spec available which is a 1 core, 1 GB RAM, 100 GB SAN Storage and 100 Mbps shared International Bandwidth. Freshly installed CentOS and wiped everything not needed due to the resource constraints. We knew it wouldn't be ideal to make it a full fledged application server so instead we made it to be a full fledged proxy server for our international traffic. Geo targeted DNS with Bind was executed so the local and international is routed accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>With the changes above, Googlebots scour our website like never before. Just 18 days after its premier, our stats show that in January 2011, Googlebots downloaded a whooping 217 GB worth of data from our website. The amazing thing is with nginx in our Biznet cloud server, the load average never even touched 1.0. Memory usage was also amazingly lean with no swap space at all. It's great to know all those gigabytes of data is served by a tiny server.</p>\n\n<p>With all that traffic, the strain was with Sofvia. We had to optimize a step further. This time we physically separated our CDN with our application server. It's a bit risky for us because we didn't have any network shared filesystem implemented yet but again because of needs, we implemented what's necessary and to our expectations memory usages dropped significantly from Sofvia. Sofvia now has more breathing space for us to optimize. Sofvia is now purely an application server and doing only that. The migration is almost complete for Sofvia.</p>\n\n<p>Enough about technicalities, now the next topic will be family. I come from a Batak family and as with any Batak family, the number one thing we Bataks have in mind is family.

Well I haven't figured it out completely, might as well write my way until I found some special formula or maybe not, who knows? I am gonna enjoy writing this, hopefully this writing will also keep you entertained.\r\n\r\nBefore anything else, please digest the writings here with a pinch of salt, some lemons and a shot of your favorite Tequila if available :p So this all began when I found myself addicted to 2 things which are cigarrettes and startups. Hey what do you know, that's the first connection.\r\n\r\nFor every addiction, until a certain level it's always good to have. What happens when that \"just enough\" dose of addiction is slightly over than how it's always has been? One thing for sure, too many cigarrettes will be bad for your health, no questions asked. The thing with startups, is enough really enough? What kind of risks and health threats can actually erase any questions from our minds?\r\n\r\nTo dig deeper, I feel I must dissect the very basic principle of a startup. As simple as 1 2 3, a founder with an idea or two is enough. Okay it might be a bit selfish and a little bit ego-maniac, yet it's true. No man's an island. Is it? Think again, when it's supposed to be a collective effort and yet it isn't. With high profile startups like Facebook or even dear Apple relying only on 1 genius respectfully, they proved all the theories wrongful.\r\n\r\nThat's just the thing, there are no theories that can be applied generally and match any startup. The web is one of the most dynamic business ever invented. With Twitter, a sub-second latency is the difference between knowing whoever it is you're following updates. The resolution for information to flow to the mass is getting microscopic these days. So how do you cope general theories to a business that is vibrant and full of changes?\r\n\r\nA simple answer, USERS. It's funny that other than the IT world, drug addicts call their \"customers\" users. What drives a startup is its users, their most valuable asset of a startup from my point of view. Their behaviors is an opportunity full of knowledge to understand.\r\n\r\nThe second answer is the PRODUCT. Now this is yet another chicken &amp; egg circle of infinity. I put the product as second best because I truly feel that before anything else, the product itself must be able to cope with its users wants and needs right from the start. This is not about thinking through every single aspect of thoughts about future users, NO! This is about creating a product able to do that by design. We are just humans, our minds are limited to our own knowledge so make the best out of it, make our minds hungry for data.\r\n\r\nTo connect the last 2 paragraphs with the paragraph before, I vote for simple minds. Simple enough to be able to decide between thatÂ irrefutableÂ binary truth of 0 or 1. I will accept arguments that there is no such thing as black and white decisions whereas grey areas are better suited for some cases. My argument is about your very own identity. How can you say yes or no both at the same time? Context is the better consideration right?\r\n\r\nAs a developer, I iterate everything loop by loop and so should the last paragraph. Context is not a reasoning for grey areas but instead is the reason behind every 0 or 1's. Throw an exception if you can't decide and let others catch them. After all, 2 minds are always better than one. Hiding weaknesses is not gonna do any good to anyone and especially to startups. Show weaknesses as a sign of strength, figure this out on your own because our mileage varies.\r\n\r\nSo I admit, running, building and nurturing a startup and everything in between is my addiction. It seems that the more problem it has, the more good to be done. It's like a pack ofÂ cigarettes and just like one, now there's only a few cigs left before I have to get another pack of cigs. I'm an A Mild person but I've fallen in love with Marlboros before, don't know, what's yours? Sharing is love ;)\r\n\r\nTo wrap things up, whatever addiction you have either you want to admit it or not is always good at some level, overdose on it and it'll kill you. Might as well enjoy the varieties lol.","html":"<p>What is the connection of a pack of cigarrettes with startups?

Blessed are we given by the Almighty tools (IDE) to get through anything life has to offer.\r\n\r\nA good IDE will ease problem fixing by giving us code completion. Isn't that great with we have something like that in life? Well, I feel not. Call me crazy but I'm a developer who actually hates logic as much as I hate chickens (I don't eat chickens, I like eggs though). Because codes/logic are the end product of something bigger than lines of codes.\r\n\r\nA great IDE is yourself.Â Being in love is a great example to illustrate what I have in mind. Mileages may vary but one thing for sure, infatuation at some level happens when you fall in love. The kind of feeling that lets you say: <em>She's hot</em>.

Quite the rush when you're doing it right?\r\n\r\nConversation leads to taking her out and enjoying the evening together. After all that, you can decipher for yourselves if it's a go or no go.Â DecisionÂ is made with lots and lots of consideration isn't it? This is when your character is tested. The most pivotal moment of falling in love, at least at the beginning. Wasting or spending too much time to think is as like doing nothing at all because that's just it, nothing.\r\n\r\nThat's the connection I want to highlight. Again I say codes/login are the end product, your actions towards your crush or someone you fell in love with is the end product. It is the love itself you felt that'll make you keep going, even after rejection in some cases. In my opinion codes/logic is never wrong, it's me as the developer not widening enough of my horizon or sometimes too vertical towards the problem that I forget how and why I love what I'm doing.\r\n\r\nYin and Yang is a state of balance right? Well I say balance is not 50-50. It's just wrong to split your head into doing something 50-50. That's only for 2 compartments, the more compartments you have, the less percentage the problems inside will get a solution. Ideally it's a must to deal with the problems 100-100. But again in life, what is ideal?\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of ideal gets shifted every single day for as long as we live our lives. So I say, no matter how much the percentage, balance doesn't necessarily mean it must be equal. As we all were taught in school, the world is 3 dimensional while Einstein says it's 4 dimensional with the fourth dimension is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">time</span>.\r\n\r\nTo handle dynamics, we gotta be dynamic. Every single problem deserve a 99% focus! Leave 1% for yourself. With time added into the formula, I feel you can follow where I'm heading into. Yup, flexibility. When it's time for A than A is 99% thought of and the same goes for B through Z. I'm dying to code all this but I'm not gonna steal your thunder. If you're a developer, code all this into something, pseudo-code style. Share it cos although problems never gets any easier, it sure as hell fun to talk about or share it with others.

As I dig deeper, it just gets more and more interesting. This won't be a technical writing like a tutorial but more to how the development scene has been evolving for the past 1 year. Putting it simple: Trends.\r\n\r\nI started my mobile development efforts with Blackberry. Against all odds, I installed the SDK on a Windows virtual machine usingÂ ParallelsÂ Desktop. The experience developing using a virtual machine was painful. For long term use, it's too slow and too awkward. Anyways, I managed to connect the Blackberry device with the IDE. So I created my first Hello World with it. It took me a great deal of my time learning about the platform. Most of the key information are for paid developers unfortunately and sadly enough, BIS is needed and I didn't have it. A big roadblock for a newbie developer.\r\n\r\nBeing dissatisfied with Blackberry, I moved on to iPhone. I got myself an iPhone 3G and boy that was the worst iPhone I've ever played with. Why I say this, the experience is just sour with iPhone 3G. The hardware couldn't keep up with apps that are demanding. However, it was even worse with its SDK. So I downloaded and installed Xcode + iPhone OS SDK (at the moment). I couldn't get apps to be deployed to the iPhone without a paid ADC membership. Well being a single minded person, I jailbroken the iPhone and followed tutorials to get it to work with my intentions.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful thing an iPhone has to offer is its native development approach. They are using Objective-C and that directly translates into better performance (supposedly) compared with Java platforms. Okay I surrender the argument, Android can use NDK instead of SDK to develop BUT only in Android, kudos to Google! Back to iPhone, I managed to get my first Hello World running. The next step was to study Objective-C in depth. The result: none. I hated pointers in C and still hate it today. So I didn't learn Objective-C at that time, instead I came across Titanium Developer.\r\n\r\nTitanium uses a wrapper API on top of Objective-C like what Objective-C is to C. The programming language is JavaScript so a web developer like me got comfy instantly. At the time, the support was still limited both in iPhone and Android however it's enough to built a simple Augmented Reality application. So I made one and boy webkit's CSS 3 3D transformation were a lifesaver! Thanks for this Webkit Developers, you guys rock! <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">With Titanium, it enabled me to focus on the app instead of the platform and that's the key point!</span>\r\n\r\nAlthough my first experience developing in iPhone left happy memories, I wasn't satisfied with its distribution in Indonesia. No one was using it so I thought why not try the Green Robot, the userbase at the time can be rounded to 0 meaning actual users were very limited. I sold the iPhone and bought a Nexus One. First impression: YEAYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nI was completely stunned how smooth an Android was. A Nexus One is Google's example of how every Android device should be and the bar was set very high! The quality of the hardware was pristine as do with any HTC devices able to run Eclair without much effort. I eventually upgraded it to Froyo and was really satisfied with the phone's performance. However, although Android can be a developer's best friend immediately, still the UX was way off compared to iPhone. It didn't bother me much, it's a motivation actually to be better than average.\r\n\r\nImmediately I started learning to develop on an Android and must I say, the learning curve was not as I expected. I never coded in Java other than Hello World in Blackberries. I was comfortable because syntax-wise, it was not quite much different than PHP. The 1 thing I was grateful in Java and PHP is Garbage Collectors. I mentioned before that Android has its own NDK allowing developers to code in pure C if needed so performance of an Android app is actually tweakable.\r\n\r\nNow I'm using an iPhone 3GS and boy it was one of my most memorable gadget buying decision. The performance woes I experienced with iPhone 3G was not present with 3GS. The experience of a proper Apple device is just magnificent. Apple focuses on experience and the consumptive nature of any perfectly normal human beings and I was sold lol.\r\n\r\nEnough with hardware, what I really want to write about is software. An example of superb apps in my opinion are Wunderlist, Evernote, Angry Birds and Instagram. This is limited only to my knowledge and the apps I have used before in any platforms so you are welcomed to debate.\r\n\r\nWunderlist is a To Do list organizer and it's available in iOS, Android (beta), Chrome Webapp (beta), Macs and Windows. This is a prime example of how an app is bringing its experience agnostically across different platforms. This particular app is made with Titanium Developer which makes its development efforts actually faster than native developments. Apart from Wunderlist's functions as an app, it showed a glimpse of the future.\r\n\r\nAfter Wunderlist, there's another productivity booster I can't live without which is Evernote. Note taking has never been so easy and because it's cloud driven, the notes are immediately available. Need I say more about this app? It's just fantastic, lifesaving and above all, all my data is available 24/7 from any device I access it with. Evernote is amazingly available for iOS, Android, Blackberry, Palm Pre/Pixi, Windows Mobile, Macs, Windows and Chrome Extension.\r\n\r\nNext up is that hyper-popular game named Angry Birds. Another example of cross platform success. Angry Birds is available initially in iOS devices but now has widen its reach to Android, Windows and Macs. A clear example of how microprices (sub $10) apps/gamesÂ flourish. I'd pay for this game without even thinking about it because it's damn cheap and I can play it in any platform I have in my hands at any moment. The experience with multiple platforms does not a change a bit, gameplay is consistent and boy its fun to play with.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, this app is only available with iOS but has instantly received success. None other than Instagram. The app is a photo sharing app instantly enabling the average person to get an experience as a professional photographer. Okay it's quite shallow but it's simple and less is more I must say! Instagram is only available for iOS but now opening up its API to be used by developers. With that many photos from millions of users, I must say it's an interesting API to play with. They are fishing for creativities and innovation from developers like you and me to use their data and turning them into food on the platter (information) for users.\r\n\r\nIf you noticed, I didn't talk anything about monetizing apps because the ecosystem is not there yet, at least if you're looking into monetizing from users. Only iOS I say have the best monetizing platform, they have paid apps and in app purchases while others still only offers paid apps. So I'll leave it for another blog post.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is as a mobile developer, I must be as agnostic as possible when it comes to platforms. Being good enough in 1 platform is not good enough. With platform fragmentation rates very high, a mobile developer need to have a clear understanding of the concept of experience. Tech stuffs I say is geeky and very interesting but it's not enough to win over users. Futuristic is cool and we're getting there ;)","html":"<p>I'm still fairly new to mobile development, just a little over a year. As I dig deeper, it just gets more and more interesting.

I did get Xcode to install though :) So instead of writing codes, I'm writing this. A 1 hour flight back to Jakarta will be the deadline.\r\n\r\nThis trip to Jogja made me realize a lot of things. As always whenever in Jogja, the 2 persons you'd want to meet is Fachry Bafadal (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/fachrybafadal\" target=\"_blank\">@fachrybafadal</a>) and Didiet Noor (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/lynxluna\" target=\"_blank\">@lynxluna</a>). The duo are entrepreneurs with their own web development agency One Bit Media (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/onebitmedia\" target=\"_blank\">@onebitmedia</a>), one of the more \"advanced\" agency in Jogja. They love to code, the basic recipe of anything great.\r\n\r\nOn my first day, I met with Didiet in a cafe near his office and started our #YKode session also with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/masbog\" target=\"_blank\">@masbog</a>. The topic was Objective-C for iOS development. It was sublime humbly speaking. Didiet is well known with his deep roots in C/C++ development and Objective-C as he told me and I quote \"Coding in Objective-C is all about chatting or having a conversation with you project\". The foundation ofÂ  Objective-C development are sending/receiving messages in such a way that it's exactly what Didiet told me. A fun and refreshing way of widening my development perspective.\r\n\r\nThe night lasted until around 10 PM when we call it a quit (for that session lol). The second session at One Bit's office was more about understanding the bigger concept of mobile development. We talked about various programming languages and platforms for mobile development. I must say this session was the most interesting session for the 3 days I'm at Jogja. What I respect the most from Didiet, he is well versed with his development efforts but he is open to new things. Usually when you're rooted to a particular language/platform, you'd go all chauvinist against the others, that's not the case with him.\r\n\r\nMe as an Android developer, the paradigm change from Android's Java to iOS' Objective-C was tough especially syntax-wise. There were a lot to take in and I truly do hate pointers. With all the concepts being thoroughly explained by Didiet, memory management have never been easier to understand. It's not only just alloc or dealloc, it's about performance. No wonder C apps runs very fast, the nature of optimizations is by default. This was exactly what I needed, to gain a better grasp of Objective-C, the big picture behind it and the #YKode sessions with Didiet was quite the experience.\r\n\r\nI stayed for 3 days and 2 nights in Jogja. The second day was looking for Batik my aunt wanted me to buy for her. This was my third time in Jogja and I wanted to know the city more so I got on a Taxi to look for motorbike rentals and guest what, met a driver Pak Mulyono and he escorted me all around Jogja to look for the Batiks my aunt is looking for. I gotta be truthful, Jogja is amazingly humble, that's a very different experience with what Jakarta has to offer. Pak Mulyono told me that although people are making relatively lower amounts of money in Jogja, they never worried about what to eat today, the next day or any other days.\r\n\r\nFood is very cheap in Jogja. I can see why Jogjakartans respected The Sultan very high, not only food is cheap, The Sultan is in support for SME's in Jogja. Becak and Andong flourish in Jogja, local contents are of high regards. Culturally, Jogja is already amazingly rich with its handicraft industries, hand made everything is keeping its economies strong together with local attractions for tourists. Well everyone knows that, what we don't already know is the potential Jogja has to offer when local contents are strong coupled with strong endorsements from The Sultan. It will be interesting in the times to come to see The Sultan lending a hand when the startup traction in Jogja is well acknowledge. The utmost regret for not attending the last Bancakan, seeing those many developers hacking their way through the night is the root of any startup. I love it :D\r\n\r\nAll and all, the last 3 days was full of Geekdom and programming philosophies, it gave me great insights into native developments from perspectives that are new, fun and full of surprises. As do with anything going on in the world wide web, every day is never the same. Didiet will call this our \"Uncomfortable Zone\", a zone where we're constantly uncomfortable dying to get ideas into executions and most importantly, doing it all with heart and passion. Thanks for the reminder guys!\r\n\r\nIt so happens that I didn't finish this blog post while in my flight back to Jakarta, the flight time was merely an hour, well at least it was too fast to be noticed. So here I am now at MOI, Kelapa Gading waiting for Jakarta's special to pass by. Traffic Jams never failed to surprise Jakartans because it's just too common, I hate it, you hate it, everyone hates it and voila, hatred towards traffic jams is now the new normal so rather than be too upset about it, I'm having a Thai Ice Tea now while waiting for a friend to meet me here.\r\n\r\nTime to wrap things up.

I have a reserved hatred towards XML and its derivative, it makes codes messy, that's why I'm doing the messy stuff with PHP and outputting it into a more \"civil\" JSON for the app to process.\r\n\r\nLuckily for me, processing RSS in PHP is a breeze with this simple library <a title=\"MagpieRSS\" href=\"http://magpierss.sourceforge.net\" target=\"_blank\">MagpieRSS</a>.

This activity is inclusive of a onResume() and onRestart() to check whether the RSS data has is still there or not due to the Android's Garbage Collector behavior, we can't know for sure if the data is still there.\r\n\r\nThere is also another class I created called DeviceInfo.java to gather unique information about devices using this application. However that particular class is not finished yet so the source code is still not final.\r\n\r\nThis wraps up the first part of this tutorial and will continue to discuss Hacktivate activity for a further more creative way to hack up AsyncTask. Stay tuned!","html":"<p>Since last weekend, I've been coding more on Android and although the topic about AsyncTask is nothing new, I just wanna bring it up again to appreciate its simplicity and more importantly in real world usable best practice. So I decided to create an RSS client from FeedBurner and this time to get feeds from <a href=\"http://www.acerid.com\">AcerID.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The application basically loads all the feeds with its first Activity, show it with the second activity and another helper Activity to send direct emails for questions related with Acer products. Do mind the layout, it's quite plain but it's usable nonetheless.

My reason is to carve out expected behaviors of a ListActivity like the standardized naming conventions for its ListView and the default row layout.\r\n\r\nFor this activity, I incorporated an external library called <a href=\"http://jsoup.org\">JSOUP</a>. It's a very useful library to deal with HTML or even HTML fragments.

It's my second time installing Lion, the first time was with the first seed released by Apple. This time is the so called Gold Release that will most likely be prime candidate for a full release.\r\n\r\nI got this DMG from the usual suspects and while reading its installation instruction, I was glad to know that it doesn't involve any DVD disc to do so. The DMG was already enough and on my 10.6.7 Snow Leopard, I mounted the DMG and followed the instructions. I choose to upgrade my Snow Leopard to Lion. To my surprise, it was dead easy.\r\n\r\nThe installer went ahead by copying the files needed for the real installation routine, after that it prompted me to restart. I followed through and the installation routine just does what it's supposed to do with a very minimal intervention. The whole process took about 40 minutes to finish.\r\n\r\nFirst boot was excruciatingly slow reaching my desktop. I figured I should reboot one more time and do a little analyzing.

It's my second time installing Lion, the first time was with the first seed released by Apple. This time is the so called Gold Release that will most likely be prime candidate for a full release.</p>\n\n<p>I got this DMG from the usual suspects and while reading its installation instruction, I was glad to know that it doesn't involve any DVD disc to do so. The DMG was already enough and on my 10.6.7 Snow Leopard, I mounted the DMG and followed the instructions. I choose to upgrade my Snow Leopard to Lion. To my surprise, it was dead easy.</p>\n\n<p>The installer went ahead by copying the files needed for the real installation routine, after that it prompted me to restart. I followed through and the installation routine just does what it's supposed to do with a very minimal intervention. The whole process took about 40 minutes to finish.</p>\n\n<p>First boot was excruciatingly slow reaching my desktop. I figured I should reboot one more time and do a little analyzing.

This is one of the most significant day of the year for me. It's a time to be thankful, reflect and most importantly taking a moment to step out of the routines and introspect. I am another year closer to my personal goals.\r\n\r\nAmongst many, I'm very grateful that during the last 1 year, everything is going upwards steadily. It's actually one of the best years in my life. I learned to code in another mobile platform, that's a biggie! A platform I was disappointed before but now has shown great potential. Another reason for me to learn the platform was because of data in Urbanesia's mobile web speaks loud and clear.\r\n\r\nI have put most of my time in the last year into one special green hope called Urbanesia. I am not alone in this matter, all 19 persons (at the moment) are the same. More specifically to a team of 4 which we as team members fondly call Betanesia. A very small team working on big projects.\r\n\r\nEach one of us are insanely committed to code like ninjas and think like Einstein. This is something I'm totally grateful to J, He has led me to shape and manage a team who are brave and always eager to learn! A team that is very dynamic, pro active, super productive and above all, <strong>PASSIONATE</strong>. Teamwork have never been more fun.\r\n\r\nMost of the paragraphs written talks about my professional life lol. I've always been passionate about what I do to a point that I realize I'm a real workaholic. Release eary, release often is in a sense the core of anything I do. Even on this day, I fell a sleep on my bed with my laptop <em>\"Abra\"</em> still powered on with an IDE in the foreground lol. It's tiresome when I think about all the things I've done but every tasks completed is an energy boost for the next task, call me crazy but it's true.\r\n\r\nDuring the last 3 months, J introduced me to another extraordinary team of 4. A team that encourages leading by example with plenty of love involved. Thank you J for letting me be a part of their lives and them as mine. A testament that love is the most subtle force on this God given earth that can and will move mountains. Love doesn't fade, it just transforms into something else and it can be as great if you let it grow :)\r\n\r\nOne of the days in the last 1 year, our family at home were blessed with a random coming of a dog. The dog suddenly came out of nowhere to our front gate, came inside and since then never wanted to go out from our gates again. We call him <em>\"Burik\"</em>. It's because his black fur is covered with brown marks all over lol. Dogs usually have oval eyes, well Burik's eyes are as round as round can be. He's always hungry to be pet and although one of the best guard dog, he knows the difference of friends and foes. Thank God for Burik, he's always a pleasant surprise every time I go to work in the morning and coming in at night.\r\n\r\nWriting about my family, every one of our big family plays an important influence in shaping who I am today. Most specifically is my Grandma. She is the lighthouse who shines every time any one of us are in need and her love towards us is amazing (an understatement still). Coming from a Batak family, our family inherits a strong value of togetherness. Love isn't always Hollywood-like, another form of love is by being tough. Spoiled since a boy but when it's time to fend myself, my family taught me that nothing is impossible when you rest your life in His hands. Every thing I do won't mean anything without Him in the driver's seat, thanks for this lesson Grandma, I love you big time!\r\n\r\nSo this wraps up another year plenty of blessings, new friends, new learnings and still with the same love towards life. Thank you for everyone who said or didn't say the things I needed, I love you all. God bless every one of you and if you're a developer, leaving you this snippet of code:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"java\" line=\"1\">(Me.isDamnGoodAtSomething()) ?

I am another year closer to my personal goals.</p>\n\n<p>Amongst many, I'm very grateful that during the last 1 year, everything is going upwards steadily. It's actually one of the best years in my life. I learned to code in another mobile platform, that's a biggie! A platform I was disappointed before but now has shown great potential. Another reason for me to learn the platform was because of data in Urbanesia's mobile web speaks loud and clear.</p>\n\n<p>I have put most of my time in the last year into one special green hope called Urbanesia. I am not alone in this matter, all 19 persons (at the moment) are the same. More specifically to a team of 4 which we as team members fondly call Betanesia. A very small team working on big projects.</p>\n\n<p>Each one of us are insanely committed to code like ninjas and think like Einstein. This is something I'm totally grateful to J, He has led me to shape and manage a team who are brave and always eager to learn! A team that is very dynamic, pro active, super productive and above all, <strong>PASSIONATE</strong>. Teamwork have never been more fun.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the paragraphs written talks about my professional life lol. I've always been passionate about what I do to a point that I realize I'm a real workaholic. Release eary, release often is in a sense the core of anything I do. Even on this day, I fell a sleep on my bed with my laptop <em>\"Abra\"</em> still powered on with an IDE in the foreground lol. It's tiresome when I think about all the things I've done but every tasks completed is an energy boost for the next task, call me crazy but it's true.</p>\n\n<p>During the last 3 months, J introduced me to another extraordinary team of 4. A team that encourages leading by example with plenty of love involved. Thank you J for letting me be a part of their lives and them as mine. A testament that love is the most subtle force on this God given earth that can and will move mountains. Love doesn't fade, it just transforms into something else and it can be as great if you let it grow :)</p>\n\n<p>One of the days in the last 1 year, our family at home were blessed with a random coming of a dog. The dog suddenly came out of nowhere to our front gate, came inside and since then never wanted to go out from our gates again. We call him <em>\"Burik\"</em>. It's because his black fur is covered with brown marks all over lol. Dogs usually have oval eyes, well Burik's eyes are as round as round can be. He's always hungry to be pet and although one of the best guard dog, he knows the difference of friends and foes. Thank God for Burik, he's always a pleasant surprise every time I go to work in the morning and coming in at night.</p>\n\n<p>Writing about my family, every one of our big family plays an important influence in shaping who I am today. Most specifically is my Grandma. She is the lighthouse who shines every time any one of us are in need and her love towards us is amazing (an understatement still). Coming from a Batak family, our family inherits a strong value of togetherness. Love isn't always Hollywood-like, another form of love is by being tough. Spoiled since a boy but when it's time to fend myself, my family taught me that nothing is impossible when you rest your life in His hands. Every thing I do won't mean anything without Him in the driver's seat, thanks for this lesson Grandma, I love you big time!</p>\n\n<p>So this wraps up another year plenty of blessings, new friends, new learnings and still with the same love towards life. Thank you for everyone who said or didn't say the things I needed, I love you all. God bless every one of you and if you're a developer, leaving you this snippet of code:</p>\n\n<pre lang=\"java\" line=\"1\">(Me.isDamnGoodAtSomething()) ?

I haven't tested thoroughly though. The class basically wraps POST &amp; GET requests to Urbanesia with OAUTH requirements.\r\n\r\nInstantiating the class, you will have to provide Consumer Key &amp; Secret obtained from Urbanesia. The current implementation requires User Key &amp; Secret for every requests too. Future release of OAUTHnesia will include non Use Key/Secret methods and XAUTH.\r\n\r\nYou will have to do the HTTP connection yourselves with your own codes, OAUTHnesia only wraps the request with proper OAUTH requirements.\r\n\r\nBase64Transcoder.h\r\n<pre lang=\"c\" line=\"1\">\r\n/*\r\n *  Base64Transcoder.h\r\n *  Base64Test\r\n *\r\n *  Created by Jonathan Wight on Tue Mar 18 2003.\r\n *  Copyright (c) 2003 Toxic Software.

I haven't tested thoroughly though. The class basically wraps POST &amp; GET requests to Urbanesia with OAUTH requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Instantiating the class, you will have to provide Consumer Key &amp; Secret obtained from Urbanesia. The current implementation requires User Key &amp; Secret for every requests too. Future release of OAUTHnesia will include non Use Key/Secret methods and XAUTH.</p>\n\n<p>You will have to do the HTTP connection yourselves with your own codes, OAUTHnesia only wraps the request with proper OAUTH requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Base64Transcoder.h  </p>\n\n<pre lang=\"c\" line=\"1\">  \n/*\n *  Base64Transcoder.h\n *  Base64Test\n *\n *  Created by Jonathan Wight on Tue Mar 18 2003.\n *  Copyright (c) 2003 Toxic Software.

A game of Digger got my undivided attention to this CGA monitor with a box beneath it overlaid with a Turbo button to pump up more Megahertz lol.\r\n\r\nWhat really made me to explore the computer was actually accidental. I forgot to insert that 5.25\" floppy disk and it went into a BASIC interpreter. A simple black screen with some keyboard shortcuts guides on the bottom. I don't really remember how I learned that it was indeed an interpreter for BASIC, I do remember that my dad had a book about Apple Basic.\r\n\r\nSo I read an English book and I don't find it easy to understand. I asked for me to learn English and I was told to watch TV movies and learn from the subtitles which I gladly did. From there I got a basic understanding and some vocabularies. I read the book again and Voila, my first \"Hello World\".\r\n\r\nSince then, the passion and the eagerness to know more about computers just grew instantly. Since the first Pentiums, I had them all, I broke a few learning about some basics in knocking a computer down and building it all up again.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until Junior High when I got my first formal introduction to programming. It was in GWBASIC. The blue background interpreter/compiler ready to accept the commands I'm giving it. I aced every programming quiz through out junior high to high school. The teachers said because it's forbidden for them to give a 10 out of 10 on my report cards, I'd have to settle for a 9.\r\n\r\nIn college, it was the same shit with different smell. My first introduction to C/C++ and all its glory. I quickly was comfortable with all the syntax. A lesson of Data Structures, famously known for its Linked List implementation was the second <strong>Prograsm</strong> I experienced as a developer.\r\n\r\nBecause of the experience, I learned and practiced that everything around you even your body is made of structures of data as one transformed into nothing else than <strong>information</strong>. It is the core of any development efforts of any developers. This what made me see programming is actually about <strong>perspectives</strong>.\r\n\r\nThere are so many programming languages whether low or high level languages but the all speak the same thing which is data. I have the tendency to admire and love languages both spoken and unspoken, so for me to learn a new language is actually very satisfying. Exploring the new and unknown is part of my identity.\r\n\r\nThat being said made me realize that I need to add more to my vocabularies and gain more knowledge. The first design in Bango29.com incorporates what I call \"<em>Hello World Of The Day</em>\" which basically randomizes Hello Worlds across different languages including spoken languages. I also tweet some of it if I find some funny things about a language.\r\n\r\nA few minutes I read an interesting article by <a href=\"http://dave.fayr.am/media/resume-2011.pdf\">Dave Fayram</a> about going back to basic with programming <a href=\"http://dave.fayr.am/posts/2011-08-19-lets-go-shopping.html\">here</a>. Dave wrote about languages in programming, he said the more languages you learn, the more <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">failure</span> you will experience along the way. This is just what's great about developers, we encounter failure every single day while coding. Especially when it's your first time coding for a new language. But then somehow, we as developers, we have this unique drive within ourselves to gain from the failure and transform failures into invaluable experiences.\r\n\r\nFrom where I sit, developers are by default entrepreneurs. I'm open for debates on this subject with a note before anything else. From code dead ends to prograsms, developers accumulate or even by nature have that basic traits as entrepreneurs, we do not accept failure as an option.

We're the luckiest people on earth ;)","html":"<p>Okay I'm being straightforward in saying: this is a rather narcissistic blog post about who else but me :p This blog is my venting mechanism or in a more subtle way, my idealism to share everything I have collectively gather throughout this irreplaceable and most grateful life as non other than a Developer.</p>\n\n<p>It all starts on an 8088 XT my dad had when I was little. A game of Digger got my undivided attention to this CGA monitor with a box beneath it overlaid with a Turbo button to pump up more Megahertz lol.</p>\n\n<p>What really made me to explore the computer was actually accidental. I forgot to insert that 5.25\" floppy disk and it went into a BASIC interpreter. A simple black screen with some keyboard shortcuts guides on the bottom. I don't really remember how I learned that it was indeed an interpreter for BASIC, I do remember that my dad had a book about Apple Basic.</p>\n\n<p>So I read an English book and I don't find it easy to understand. I asked for me to learn English and I was told to watch TV movies and learn from the subtitles which I gladly did. From there I got a basic understanding and some vocabularies. I read the book again and Voila, my first \"Hello World\".</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the passion and the eagerness to know more about computers just grew instantly. Since the first Pentiums, I had them all, I broke a few learning about some basics in knocking a computer down and building it all up again.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn't until Junior High when I got my first formal introduction to programming. It was in GWBASIC. The blue background interpreter/compiler ready to accept the commands I'm giving it. I aced every programming quiz through out junior high to high school. The teachers said because it's forbidden for them to give a 10 out of 10 on my report cards, I'd have to settle for a 9.</p>\n\n<p>In college, it was the same shit with different smell. My first introduction to C/C++ and all its glory. I quickly was comfortable with all the syntax. A lesson of Data Structures, famously known for its Linked List implementation was the second <strong>Prograsm</strong> I experienced as a developer.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the experience, I learned and practiced that everything around you even your body is made of structures of data as one transformed into nothing else than <strong>information</strong>. It is the core of any development efforts of any developers. This what made me see programming is actually about <strong>perspectives</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>There are so many programming languages whether low or high level languages but the all speak the same thing which is data. I have the tendency to admire and love languages both spoken and unspoken, so for me to learn a new language is actually very satisfying. Exploring the new and unknown is part of my identity.</p>\n\n<p>That being said made me realize that I need to add more to my vocabularies and gain more knowledge. The first design in Bango29.com incorporates what I call \"<em>Hello World Of The Day</em>\" which basically randomizes Hello Worlds across different languages including spoken languages. I also tweet some of it if I find some funny things about a language.</p>\n\n<p>A few minutes I read an interesting article by <a href=\"http://dave.fayr.am/media/resume-2011.pdf\">Dave Fayram</a> about going back to basic with programming <a href=\"http://dave.fayr.am/posts/2011-08-19-lets-go-shopping.html\">here</a>. Dave wrote about languages in programming, he said the more languages you learn, the more <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">failure</span> you will experience along the way. This is just what's great about developers, we encounter failure every single day while coding. Especially when it's your first time coding for a new language. But then somehow, we as developers, we have this unique drive within ourselves to gain from the failure and transform failures into invaluable experiences.</p>\n\n<p>From where I sit, developers are by default entrepreneurs. I'm open for debates on this subject with a note before anything else. From code dead ends to prograsms, developers accumulate or even by nature have that basic traits as entrepreneurs, we do not accept failure as an option. Yet in the same time, we never worked a day in our lives.</p>\n\n<p>The paragraph before this is again highly debatable especially after reading an article by Jeff Atwoork at <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com\">CodingHorror.com</a> titled <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/01/how-to-become-a-better-programmer-by-not-programming.html\"><em>\"How To Become A Programmer Without Programming\"</em>.</a> The article divides between those who can and those who can't like either you have or you don't.

Only a few meetups with light discussions were my extracurricular activities, the rest was mostly spent learning on new platforms and new mindsets.\r\n\r\nIt's been more than a year since my first introduction to the digital community in Indonesia. StartupLokal was the first amongst many. Nowadays, I haven't attended the monthly meetups due to conflicting schedules. A few days ago I met some friends from the community and their first response was \"<em>Where the hell have I been?</em>\".\r\n\r\nI really miss chatting, discussing and basically do anything and everything related with geekdom but I guess everyone has their own ways to express the geekness in ourselves. Some chooses to shine on the limelight, some do more codes than socializing vice versa, some doesn't really care too much about the art and invest their time in building business relationships and some are ignorant of what's going on to the point when somewhere along the way, a kickass product is created.\r\n\r\nWell the digital landscape is home to a lot of personalities and different perspectives. It just shows how culturally vibrant Indonesia is. The fine line that connect us all is simply passion for what we do. A line that is fragile to say the least. I would feel that I am doing it all because it's just the very principle thing that defines me as a human being, it is my identity.\r\n\r\nThe things is, passion is just not enough for now. Indonesia need a bigger, larger and more dramatic kickstart in Its digital landscape. Something like what <a title=\"Spicy!\" href=\"http://sangatpedas.com/indonesia-startups-war/\">Remco wrote at SangatPedas.com here</a>. I couldn't agree more with Remco on that matter. We need drama, if you ask me why, it's because our digital landscape identity is blurry at best.\r\n\r\nNow I'm a firm believer of anything can happen at any time meaning that whatever I wrote here or whatever I've told someone offline could be proven as nothing more than rants. But that's just it, I say what I mean! Anyways, the digital landscape is maturing here in Indonesia. We see big names coming to Indonesia and also local corporations making the landscape more vast than it was. With that in mind we need to establish some common sense of INDONESIA.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna do a cliche written as a case study below:\r\n<blockquote>Soekarno is geek and has always been one since his first introduction to geekdom. He's been \"Hello World\"-ing since early in the days where floppy disks are integral part of a computer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter he graduates from High School, he finds himself more and more intrigued by the art of \"Hello World\". He enrolled in a University where it is one of the best Computer Science learning facility in Indonesia or so what the general consensus says.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe was stressed! Until High School, he was forced to learn all the non sense he doesn't need while at University, the deja vu couldn't get any more clearer, same shit with different smell only more expensive than before.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo Soekarno told himself that it's another learning curve he just have to endure.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen he graduated and the title \"Sarjana Komputer\" was proudly entitled to his name, he started to look for a job only to find that he was just 1 of a million.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSoekarno finally got a job! He was happy and all smiles when he got accepted at a Multi National Company here in Jakarta. He thought, things will be different here, he's sure that being an MNC, the mindsets are more broad.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSuffice to say, he was disappointed yet again. Soekarno was considered as a \"Tukang\" or translating it plainly to English as a Handyman. Most colleagues will call him \"Orang IT Gue\" or again translating to \"The IT Guy\". He was proficient in programming but his job description was augmented to fix/crimp loose LAN cables and figuring out why the printer is not printing.</blockquote>\r\nThe case study above can and will happen to any developer anywhere in the world. But here in Indonesia it is more obvious and considered a norm in everyday professional lives. Well that's the risk of having a career in a service oriented industry. There's no one to blame here, it's just how it is here in Indonesia. Labor is cheap in Indonesia, what's happening is the effect.\r\n\r\nThis is why having an IDENTITY is as crucial as the art of developing itself. Big names that evolves as a startup initially are mostly founded by developers, developers who knew how valuable they are. Instead of trying to change the world, they changed their perspective towards themselves and the world.\r\n\r\nI hope the case study above will never happen in startups here in Indonesia. As founders, you'd be amazed on how far someone will go if you inspire them enough and appreciate their values. For other types of companies, as the startups here in Indonesia is maturing, in the long run, I'm hopeful that the case study above will finally diminish itself.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote before, <strong>YOU ARE YOU'RE OWN STARTUP</strong>.

I'm running it smoothly on my Nexian Journey and it's time to do some changes to CM's default theme to show my own.\r\n\r\nEither creating the splash screen or the boot animation, each of the tasks have its own complication. I'm gonna start off by creating a boot animation.\r\n\r\nI created my boot animation using Adobe Photoshop CS4. Create the animation just like creating a GIF animation. First you need to know the LCD resolution of the device you're gonna implement it with. Mine is 320x480 and that's gonna be the base here.\r\n<pre lang=\"bash\">1. Create a new file on Photoshop and adjust the width &amp; height dimension to you device's\r\n2. Do all the required animation framing using Photoshop's Animator (Window / Animation)\r\n3. Now you must logically part the animation into 2 sections. The first will be the initial non loop animation while the second will be the animation that's gonna be looped forever\r\n4. Convert to Frame Animation\r\n5. Flatten Animation to layers\r\n6. Okay this gonna sound silly, I saved all the layers one by one. For the first animation section, save it anywhere under the folder part0 -&gt; You gotta save it into PNG 8 Bit with any file name as long as it's numerical according to its sequence. Ex: bango_001.png bango_002.png bango_003.png\r\n7. Do the same for the second animation section continuing the file naming sequence from the first part and save all the frames under part1\r\n8. Within the same folder where the part0 and part1 is located, create a new text file desc.txt\r\n9. The content will be:\r\n   320 480 24\r\n   p 1 0 part0\r\n   p 0 0 part1\r\n10. Still in the same folder as step 9, do the following:\r\n    $ zip -r0 bootanimation.zip *\r\n11. Voila</pre>\r\nNow to create a splash image is quite more challenging doing it on a MAC but thanks to <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=683303\" target=\"_blank\">this thread</a> in <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com\" target=\"_blank\">XDA Developers</a>, we're all set. I'm merely copy pasting the steps on the thread, all credits should go to the author of the thread.\r\n\r\nYou will need to create a new executable BASH file with the contents below:\r\n<pre lang=\"bash\">#!/bin/bash\r\nprog_header() {\r\n\techo \"###############################\"\r\n\techo \"####### EleGoS's FFMPEG #######\"\r\n\techo \"# G1/Sapphire/MyTouch3G/Magic #\"\r\n\techo \"### Splash Screen converter ###\"\r\n\techo \"###############################\"\r\n\techo \"version 1.0\"\r\n\techo \"\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nif [ \"$1\" == \"--help\" ] || [ \"$1\" == \"-h\"  ]; then\r\n\tprog_header\r\n\techo \"Usage\"\r\n\techo \"$0 your_image_file\"\r\n\texit 0\r\nfi\r\n\r\nwarning() {\r\n\tprintf \"\\e[0;31m$1\\e[0m \\n\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ncheck_ok() {\r\n\tprintf \"\\e[0;32m$1\\e[0m \\n\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nffmpeg_check=$(which ffmpeg)\r\nsize_check=307200\r\nsize_desc=\"320x480\"\r\n\r\nif [ \"$ffmpeg_check\" != \"\" ]; then\r\n\tOUTPUT=$(echo \"$1\" | cut -d'.' -f1).raw565\r\n\tclear\r\n\tprog_header\r\n\tffmpeg -i $1 -f rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb565 $OUTPUT\r\n\tclear\r\n\tprog_header\r\n\tFILESIZE=$(cat $OUTPUT | wc -c)\r\n\tif [ $FILESIZE -eq $size_check ]; then\r\n\t\tcheck_ok \"$OUTPUT is ready to be flashed.\"\r\n\telse\r\n\t\trm $OUTPUT\r\n\t\twarning \"$OUTPUT filesize mismatches!

To flash both the boot animation and the splash screen, I'm sure a quick search in Google will come up a few pages explaining the steps. Enjoy!","html":"<p>So far my experience compiling my own version of Android using CyanogenMod 7.1 <a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/blog/2011/building-android-gingerbread-cyanogenmod-7-1-for-nexian-journey-mac-os-x-lion\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> is as sharp as it can be. I'm running it smoothly on my Nexian Journey and it's time to do some changes to CM's default theme to show my own.</p>\n\n<p>Either creating the splash screen or the boot animation, each of the tasks have its own complication. I'm gonna start off by creating a boot animation.</p>\n\n<p>I created my boot animation using Adobe Photoshop CS4. Create the animation just like creating a GIF animation. First you need to know the LCD resolution of the device you're gonna implement it with. Mine is 320x480 and that's gonna be the base here.  </p>\n\n<pre lang=\"bash\">1. Create a new file on Photoshop and adjust the width &amp; height dimension to you device's  \n2. Do all the required animation framing using Photoshop's Animator (Window / Animation)  \n3. Now you must logically part the animation into 2 sections. The first will be the initial non loop animation while the second will be the animation that's gonna be looped forever  \n4. Convert to Frame Animation  \n5. Flatten Animation to layers  \n6. Okay this gonna sound silly, I saved all the layers one by one. For the first animation section, save it anywhere under the folder part0 -&gt; You gotta save it into PNG 8 Bit with any file name as long as it's numerical according to its sequence. Ex: bango_001.png bango_002.png bango_003.png  \n7. Do the same for the second animation section continuing the file naming sequence from the first part and save all the frames under part1  \n8. Within the same folder where the part0 and part1 is located, create a new text file desc.txt  \n9. The content will be:  \n   320 480 24\n   p 1 0 part0\n   p 0 0 part1\n10. Still in the same folder as step 9, do the following:  \n    $ zip -r0 bootanimation.zip *\n11. Voila</pre>  \n\n<p>Now to create a splash image is quite more challenging doing it on a MAC but thanks to <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=683303\" target=\"_blank\">this thread</a> in <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com\" target=\"_blank\">XDA Developers</a>, we're all set. I'm merely copy pasting the steps on the thread, all credits should go to the author of the thread.</p>\n\n<p>You will need to create a new executable BASH file with the contents below:  </p>\n\n<pre lang=\"bash\">#!/bin/bash  \nprog_header() {  \n    echo \"###############################\"\n    echo \"####### EleGoS's FFMPEG #######\"\n    echo \"# G1/Sapphire/MyTouch3G/Magic #\"\n    echo \"### Splash Screen converter ###\"\n    echo \"###############################\"\n    echo \"version 1.0\"\n    echo \"\"\n}\n\nif [ \"$1\" == \"--help\" ] || [ \"$1\" == \"-h\"  ]; then  \n    prog_header\n    echo \"Usage\"\n    echo \"$0 your_image_file\"\n    exit 0\nfi\n\nwarning() {  \n    printf \"\\e[0;31m$1\\e[0m \\n\"\n}\n\ncheck_ok() {  \n    printf \"\\e[0;32m$1\\e[0m \\n\"\n}\n\nffmpeg_check=$(which ffmpeg)  \nsize_check=307200  \nsize_desc=\"320x480\"\n\nif [ \"$ffmpeg_check\" != \"\" ]; then  \n    OUTPUT=$(echo \"$1\" | cut -d'.' -f1).raw565\n    clear\n    prog_header\n    ffmpeg -i $1 -f rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb565 $OUTPUT\n    clear\n    prog_header\n    FILESIZE=$(cat $OUTPUT | wc -c)\n    if [ $FILESIZE -eq $size_check ]; then\n        check_ok \"$OUTPUT is ready to be flashed.\"\n    else\n        rm $OUTPUT\n        warning \"$OUTPUT filesize mismatches! Wrong image size ($size_desc)? Aborted.\"\n        exit 0\n    fi\n    echo \"In order to flash this image you have to plug your phone in fastboot mode.\"\n    read -p \"Flash it now?

Everyone was in awe for what he did but mostly for what he didn't do I suppose. He shaped the mobile landscape as we know today and for the years to come.\r\n\r\nI believe strongly that mobile developers are candidly smart but also stupid at the same time, this includes myself. We are smart because we embrace a whole new paradigm and concept in programming that is actually still maturing. There is no one size fits all platform that will deliver everything a developer would need. The most stupid thing of all is actually focusing only on a single platform instead of the product.\r\n\r\nWhile implementing a fresh way to develop mobile products, a notable early stage investor here in Indonesia told me that the technology I was implementing is still 2-3 years ahead of the industry. He was damn right in saying, \"<em>What's the point? Going native is still the answer (for now)</em>\". In spite of all cross platform goodness, there's always a catch.\r\n\r\nSo why do any developments I said to myself? It's just a waste of time and energy because it's not an easy task to focus on different platforms at the same time. UI on every platform is different whether programmatically or its actual visual equivalent when users see them. I just can't see any single solution will ever be ready for prime time in the near future. This being said by someone who has coded and NOT by analyst or writers who never coded their whole lives.\r\n\r\nAnyways, the distant future is not so distant after all if you got cash for it. Just like the rest of the population, getting a US$ 500+ device is just too expensive. Although here in Jakarta, the trend is the higher the merrier for shops and buyers, it does not cater the whole population. People want first class products even if the could only spend less.\r\n\r\nPremium sound premium because other devices make them <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">look &amp; feel</span> premium. The physical properties of a device is the first thing anyone will notice. Nowadays form factors are suited for your thumbs and the way devices look these days are increasingly (subjectively) \"<em>better</em>\" with at least 10 years ago as a comparison. Devices don't have explicitly visible antennas, they're also getting smaller, lighter and the batteries although Internet connected most of the time still lasts longer relatively.\r\n\r\nCameras and phones is a match no one would argue and now 2 Megapixels is what you get at least. Although the quality won't be that of pictures taken from a pocket camera but the technology is keeping up. We see phones sporting 8 Megapixels lenses from big names that used to be premium. Not to mention the success experienced by Instagram clarifies the argument even stronger. Remember those cheesy frames when you got your first Nokia camera phone, unnoticed and unaware, that's Augmented Reality in a somewhat more primitive conceptualization.\r\n\r\nProcessors are getting double its core and power every year but sadly, not so with applications. I see a lot of time, software as an actual performance-hindering component even through upgrades of more advanced specs. What we can still be thankful is cheap memory (storage). You can easily get an 8-64 gigs Mini SD Card for at least $ 12.\r\n\r\nSo yes hardware is getting more powerful but the price is still a major barrier for end users to enjoy their own devices. If the device has a bitten Apple logo in it, people are used to paying premium, it is a premium device with all its glory. Coupled with a great recent iOS 5.0 release, it's only gonna get better and better delivering the needs and wants of the whole market.\r\n\r\nAndroid is catching up and has recently dethrone iPhone as the number 1 best selling smartphone in the world. What does this mean to developers and end users? Here's a few pros and cons about Android as a platform:\r\n\r\n<strong>Cons</strong><strong>:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The User Experience is plain and prone to rather extreme iterative changes for every Android version.</li>\r\n\t<li>Due to inconsistency in its User Interface, for each new version boasts a whole new look and it really is causing more problems than solutions, even though functions are defined constantly.</li>\r\n\t<li>Dalvik is a great JVM with incredible clarity for Garbage Collectors. The report of freed memory by GC is actually very demotivating. Try inflating sub views, you'll see why.</li>\r\n\t<li>Doesn't run well at all for devices &lt; 800 MHz ARM processors. Samsung Galaxy Mini is a best seller, due to its popularity it can lead first time Android end users to associate Android with lag and unresponsive behaviors.</li>\r\n\t<li>Multi threading is an alienated term for asynchronous. Sure there are classes to do this efficiently but this knocks down more creativity as do with most of C derived languages.</li>\r\n\t<li>Fragmentation of different versions of Android makes developers support the lowest acceptable API level and end users stuck with whatever the handset maker offer.</li>\r\n\t<li>Handset maker more often than not can't keep up with Google's amazingly fast iterative updates.</li>\r\n\t<li>Free as in free beer, \"<em>Google Experience</em>\" devices will cost OEMs and or handset makers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Quality apps in terms of UI/UX are nothing at all in quantity compared to iOS, Android is ok but not beautiful. Very subjective and open for debate.</li>\r\n\t<li>A very dismal post-sales options to get upgrades to newer Android versions even if the device is still on warranty. After-market ROMs are available but this NOT the case with end users, still need guts and technical knowledge although I know a few non-technical friends of mine who does it almost naturally.</li>\r\n\t<li>A very insecure platform! Don't ever root an Android if you're not up for its risks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Pros:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Any developer with a spare time can always build their own version of Android. Customizable deep to kernel level, a talented developer can do magic with it.</li>\r\n\t<li>Knowledge is available everywhere on the Internet.</li>\r\n\t<li>Java is a relatively more well known language.</li>\r\n\t<li>Layout is very flexible thanks to XMLs, seriously this is the first time I'm grateful of XML lol.</li>\r\n\t<li>The growth chart is amazingly exponential, currently already topping off the iPhone.</li>\r\n\t<li>Lets mid to low market to have a go at touch screen phones that is always connected. Opens up new possibilities especially for educating the general population about being online.</li>\r\n\t<li>Because of looser supervisions of Android Market, it makes a great playing ground to test out new ideas, even half baked and see how the market responses.</li>\r\n\t<li>Best practices are commonly available and design patterns in Java is very strong, one can be ready for prime time in no time.</li>\r\n\t<li>Although heavily fragmented, developers are often given the option to adopt new frameworks available in higher API levels with a sort of compatibility library to enable them on lower API levels.</li>\r\n\t<li>The kind of technology embedded into Android's stack is already very extensive and very well though of although I have found some cases like a Multipart HTTP request library is only available if you use third party libraries or by making your own methods. Easily forgivable though in contrast.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThere is still more to add to the 2 lists above but the ones written are the ones I feel worth noting. Other platforms have their own pros/cons but as any data will show, Android is topping the smartphone market and that's a fact. It is the future, especially here in Indonesia. Due to Android's nature of being open, adopting it is not so much a trivial task.\r\n\r\nIn China, Android is modded very heavily to suit China's own needs for a smartphone. Most of the effort are made possible again because of Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Why can't we do this for Indonesia? With or without the government on our back, we have a great market. It's puzzling to not see an Android made by Indonesians being sold to Indonesians when we as Indonesians are well know for our desire and passion of making technological advances out of nothing. <a href=\"http://opensource.telkomspeedy.com/wiki/index.php/Wajanbolic_e-goen\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Wajanbolic</em></a> is none other the best example.\r\n\r\nWe owe this to ourselves! As a person involved in the tech world of Indonesia generally, I applause Nexian for its bold efforts in having a very strong C/C++ team of developers to mod its own MTK feature phones. It's not an easy thing to do but in the end of the day, end users want more beyond its low price. I truly hope Nexian will set an example with its Android phones.\r\n\r\nBeing a dreamer, one can visualize a very mobile and an actually high tech tomorrow without end users having to fuss with technical jargons and or spec to be persuaded to buy a smartphone. Like any startup will tell, a good product will market and sell itself. We can still empower and influence the market, it's just a shame if we see this kind of success and control not in the hands of local companies. We know what our market need, not to mention their wants. Look at Google, Facebook, Groupon, etc, their investing so much to become hyperlocal and we just stood there and made to watch as our great market is slowly but surely taken over.\r\n\r\nRead the paragraph before with some lime and a pinch of salt, my purpose is simple, it's the future and nothing else. If anyone is reading this and somehow is disagree with my writings, the comments below is open for anything.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, it would be great if we can analyze different user behaviors in a collective way. This will benefit us all without sacrificing privacy though. Although here in Indonesia nobody gives a damn about privacy but I still believe in ethical means in doing it. I'm just not sure the industry itself is ready. I have some data and would love to share with yours. Let's be smart about this.\r\n\r\nAll and all, the mobile landscape in Indonesia still very early in its infancy, we have the upper hand of knowing what the market like and how to capitalize on it. Let's make that disruptive force coming from us and of course for us. Aren't you tired of making a living outside Indonesia because our market is still not ready yet? Well it's gonna happen soon and you better be ready for it. I'm game, are you?\r\n<blockquote>Indonesians like to buy things they don't need, they buy what they want as proof of their existence and identity.

Technology.\r\n\r\nDissecting and subordinating the impossible usually starts with <strong>HOW</strong>. How did you do it? How do we sew the strands to finally forms a piece of clothing? Technology in this virtual age is all about data. They are the fundamental element that shapes a computer as we know it today. Data on its own is useless, no matter if it is 1 Byte or 1 Terabytes, it does not hold any value unless value is added to them.\r\n\r\nInstead of starting with how, let's start with <strong>WHAT</strong>. In the stone age, a piece of clothing we wear everyday might seem like Star Trek for the humans of that era. It is unthinkable because they don't know there is clothing, yet.

So now the question is <em>What is The Impossible?</em> Every one of us are slaves to our own knowledge about our own understanding of how things work. Not limited only in a technical sense but more general even life's very own existence. How well do you know your lives? How far will you go the distance between impossible and Possible. As stated before, technology is knowledge while knowledge is power (material) so technology equals power.

More often than not, consumed by the myriad of foreign knowledge not yet proven by ourselves. Rejecting, resisting or even denying seems to be the first acceptable solution. Questioning if it is right for ourselves. Unit testing the knowledge with past experiences. This leads to approval from someone more experienced. Approval also sometimes means acknowledgement by our peers.\r\n\r\nThe learning process of it all will sometime redefine our understanding about how things work and in extreme ways make us rethink and conclude a whole different set of knowledge. Knowledge that will add value to a set of data, transforming it into one of those moments when you just stop for a while and smile at it. To put it in a more familiar term, <strong>INSPIRATION</strong>. Undefined (null) moments when you found a solution for a problem you've been having or someone else's.

How do you somehow collect all those strands and weave them into a single united strands that we wear everyday? Easy, a needle, strands with enough length and a significant amount of time and energy should suffice. So what's the substance connecting all the dots? Technology.</p>\n\n<p>Dissecting and subordinating the impossible usually starts with <strong>HOW</strong>. How did you do it? How do we sew the strands to finally forms a piece of clothing? Technology in this virtual age is all about data. They are the fundamental element that shapes a computer as we know it today. Data on its own is useless, no matter if it is 1 Byte or 1 Terabytes, it does not hold any value unless value is added to them.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of starting with how, let's start with <strong>WHAT</strong>. In the stone age, a piece of clothing we wear everyday might seem like Star Trek for the humans of that era. It is unthinkable because they don't know there is clothing, yet.

I can't find myself to sleep at this hour because after a few years of never exercising and or playing any kind of sports, I was too drained. So here I am writing a blog post about something <a title=\"Rama Mamuaya\" href=\"http://twitter.com/rampok\" target=\"_blank\">Rama</a> and me talked about before we played.\r\n\r\nAbout a week ago, I caught up with <a title=\"Ariel Komang\" href=\"http://twitter.com/chazzuka\" target=\"_blank\">Ariel</a> and <a title=\"Okto Silaban\" href=\"http://twitter.com/labanux\" target=\"_blank\">Okto</a> at Setiabudi One to have some geek talks. We met up around 8 PM and as always, we lost track of time and were home early in the morning. We talked about a lot of things that we agreed and also didn't agreed. Technical stuffs like scaling a website and also some off topics like there were no mosquitos around while we were there lol.\r\n\r\nThat night, we didn't have any pre-arrangements about what to do or even a topic to talk about, we just talked about the <em>awesomeness</em> of what we do. What interests me was that there is a topic not about technicalities that we couldn't agree more besides any other topics. The harsh realities of being an engineer in a web company in Indonesia whether it is a startup or its more mature form.\r\n\r\nI have no usable work experience in other countries but it seems that in Indonesia, we the engineer is more often described of a handyman than anything else. My experience in several companies I worked for and with further clarify this particular stigma. Every engineer, supervisors, manager and C-Level execs know this but especially engineers. This is part of our culture to devaluate skills.\r\n\r\nMy question which I asked to the 3 guys mentioned above was:\r\n<blockquote>So what is the use of making yourself even better, more aware and \"smarter\" than who you are right now engineers?</blockquote>\r\nThis question spurred different answers from different perspectives. One answer is: that particular question I asked is what actually drives talent off Â to fled to better opportunities with especially betterÂ remuneration. A mentality I call \"<em>Hire Me</em>\". Even Facebook, Google, Apple and the rest of the gang is basically doing the same thing.\r\n\r\nAnother answer is rather giving but not much different from the above. This is the fact we're living upon, either you accept it or don't. Whichever decision doesn't make any difference to the current state. This creates a care-free mentality of as long as the job is done as requested and meeting the deadline on time, then it's a success.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, it's not just because I'm coming from a technical background but I value technical skills greatly. They're the very foundation of being an engineer. I have the luckiest opportunity to be able to meet and be friends with great engineers. Engineers who keep redefining who they are which a direct inheritance of the discipline itself.\r\n\r\nOn the Internet, there is so much going on at any given moment in a programming world where everything is a variable and a second late is equal to being obsolete.Â An engineer has to absorb,Â conceptualizeÂ and implement abstracts like design patterns, business flows, etc into Â a unified product for the mass to enjoy. This comes with theÂ occasionalÂ bumps and bruises everything you code.\r\n\r\nBeing an engineer is actually when your left and right brain really being stimulated. There's another way of doing something more efficiently, better and faster depending on its context. Mark Zuckerberg even called Facebook's engineering ethic as \"<em>The Hacker Way</em>\".\r\n\r\nWith all the reality of being an engineer especially here in Indonesia, where does this place engineers? I say engineers are pretty much dumb if they don't ask the question I asked above. As an engineer, that urge to learn something new is a basic trait to be successful as one. This is probably the ultimate reason why engineers in Indonesia can cope with the reality. An engineer's <em>Kryptonite</em>: <strong>Knowledge</strong>.\r\n\r\nHopefully the market breaking activities of the newcomers with fat backings in Indonesia will set an example and hopefully a standard. Startups are here to make money, engineers are there to let the StartupÂ make money. If the sentence before this reverbs eloquently over and over with C-Level execs, only then we engineers are accommodated accordingly.\r\n\r\nTechnology counts a great deal in startups, if you can't fathom this, you probably should be doing something else or your CTO is so damn good that you never realize the kind of technology implemented supporting a startup.\r\n\r\nI sincerely is on the positive end of this blog post, don't take this blog post as a complaint or the sorts, this is merely being realistic yet still hopeful that Indonesia is as capable and as great as any other matured internet market in the world.\r\n\r\nTo wrap things up, I wish you a good night sleep cos this blog post is finally making me wants to sleep for the night. Gonna leave with a quote from earlier blog posts:\r\n<blockquote>You're <strong>GREAT</strong>, get used to it!</blockquote>","html":"<p>This has been a fun day of basketball with the guys.

Technical stuffs like scaling a website and also some off topics like there were no mosquitos around while we were there lol.</p>\n\n<p>That night, we didn't have any pre-arrangements about what to do or even a topic to talk about, we just talked about the <em>awesomeness</em> of what we do. What interests me was that there is a topic not about technicalities that we couldn't agree more besides any other topics. The harsh realities of being an engineer in a web company in Indonesia whether it is a startup or its more mature form.</p>\n\n<p>I have no usable work experience in other countries but it seems that in Indonesia, we the engineer is more often described of a handyman than anything else. My experience in several companies I worked for and with further clarify this particular stigma. Every engineer, supervisors, manager and C-Level execs know this but especially engineers. This is part of our culture to devaluate skills.</p>\n\n<p>My question which I asked to the 3 guys mentioned above was:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>So what is the use of making yourself even better, more aware and \"smarter\" than who you are right now engineers?</blockquote>  \n\n<p>This question spurred different answers from different perspectives. One answer is: that particular question I asked is what actually drives talent off Â to fled to better opportunities with especially betterÂ remuneration. A mentality I call \"<em>Hire Me</em>\". Even Facebook, Google, Apple and the rest of the gang is basically doing the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>Another answer is rather giving but not much different from the above. This is the fact we're living upon, either you accept it or don't. Whichever decision doesn't make any difference to the current state. This creates a care-free mentality of as long as the job is done as requested and meeting the deadline on time, then it's a success.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective, it's not just because I'm coming from a technical background but I value technical skills greatly. They're the very foundation of being an engineer. I have the luckiest opportunity to be able to meet and be friends with great engineers. Engineers who keep redefining who they are which a direct inheritance of the discipline itself.</p>\n\n<p>On the Internet, there is so much going on at any given moment in a programming world where everything is a variable and a second late is equal to being obsolete.Â An engineer has to absorb,Â conceptualizeÂ and implement abstracts like design patterns, business flows, etc into Â a unified product for the mass to enjoy. This comes with theÂ occasionalÂ bumps and bruises everything you code.</p>\n\n<p>Being an engineer is actually when your left and right brain really being stimulated. There's another way of doing something more efficiently, better and faster depending on its context. Mark Zuckerberg even called Facebook's engineering ethic as \"<em>The Hacker Way</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>With all the reality of being an engineer especially here in Indonesia, where does this place engineers? I say engineers are pretty much dumb if they don't ask the question I asked above. As an engineer, that urge to learn something new is a basic trait to be successful as one. This is probably the ultimate reason why engineers in Indonesia can cope with the reality. An engineer's <em>Kryptonite</em>: <strong>Knowledge</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully the market breaking activities of the newcomers with fat backings in Indonesia will set an example and hopefully a standard. Startups are here to make money, engineers are there to let the StartupÂ make money. If the sentence before this reverbs eloquently over and over with C-Level execs, only then we engineers are accommodated accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Technology counts a great deal in startups, if you can't fathom this, you probably should be doing something else or your CTO is so damn good that you never realize the kind of technology implemented supporting a startup.</p>\n\n<p>I sincerely is on the positive end of this blog post, don't take this blog post as a complaint or the sorts, this is merely being realistic yet still hopeful that Indonesia is as capable and as great as any other matured internet market in the world.</p>\n\n<p>To wrap things up, I wish you a good night sleep cos this blog post is finally making me wants to sleep for the night. Gonna leave with a quote from earlier blog posts:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>You're <strong>GREAT</strong>, get used to it!</blockquote>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1387126098348,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1387126098348,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1338338687000,"published_by":1},{"id":166,"uuid":"0acc8de3-f53e-4229-98f8-2a2db698e2d0","title":"Urbanesia - Open Source & Microsoft","slug":"urbanesia-open-source-microsoft","markdown":"Today I was a speaker at Microsoft's SQL on PHP event and I'm displaying the slides for the presentation below.

Experiments and experience is delivering us to new heights. So many things I'd love to share but will do so when it's due.

To wrap things up, all the randomness above leads to this. There is no such thing as a perfect product, even miserably so, a perfect technology to support products.

Well now with the Urbanesia team and also past members of the team, we've created a native Windows 8 app for Urbanesia. We were in it from the start when Windows 8 was seeded as a Developer Preview. Our first IDE was Visual Studio 11 Beta that is now Visual Studio 2012.\r\n\r\nUrbanesia is a BizSpark member and therefore, we gained benefits such as being the first to enjoy Microsoft products that has yet been released publicly. Our MSDN account enables us to download almost all of Microsoft's commercial, development and enterprise products to be used without any complicated and expensive expenses for 3 years. I downloaded Windows 8 Pro and Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/blog/2012/microsoft-windows-8-bootcamp-bandung\" target=\"_blank\">Our Windows 8 Bootcamp</a> back in August taught us the core of coding for Windows 8. It's relatively easy and stress free if you're accustomed to Open Source flavours previously. We created a basic application in a few hours and learned how to effectively structure your web services data. Gained all of that knowledge really quick and mostly painless.\r\n\r\nWindows 8 is now approaching its launch date and we were given an ARM tablet by Microsoft installed with WinRT to test our development efforts. To be honest, the tablet is great but we didn't know what to do with it. We used it mostly to test our upcoming iteration of Urbanesia's frontend web face. I got a Windows laptop with a really low spec and decided to install Windows 8 there and do some development work for our app.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you this, to develop for Windows 8, you must install Visual Studio 2012 on a Windows 8 device. Trying to develop for Windows 8 on versions less than Windows 8 will give you a friendly warning that you're fucked. This friendly warning made me download a Windows 8 ISO image from Microsoft. It turns out that our MSDN subscription was loaded with Windows 8 RTM and I followed through.\r\n\r\nI installed Windows 8 on that crappy Windows laptop without any trouble and finding the performance of the laptop acceptable when I logged in. It wasn't the same case with the Windows 7 installation. Microsoft did a great job with their new OS, really.\r\n\r\nWhen Visual Studio 2012 was installed, I wasn't expecting any trouble with our source code, but nothing great is produced without first encountering problems right? To keep it simple, the application didn't work at all. Spent the better part of my Sunday to scour Google for answers. Before the Manchester United game (that they won), I can't find what's not working.\r\n\r\nFYI, we are coding in C# for our Windows 8 application.\r\n\r\nAfter the game, I was gonna give up but then inspiration usually comes when you're about to give up. I hacked my way again into the source code and below is a list of gotchas you should pay attention when you're gonna convert older Visual Studio 11 Beta projects to a Visual Studio 12 project:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>After you realize that you're fucked, close the solution for the project you're working and create another project.</li>\r\n\t<li>Close that new project you've just created and open up the primary project.</li>\r\n\t<li>Copy paste your Common\\StandardStyles.xaml file somewhere.</li>\r\n\t<li>Open up explorer and navigate your way to the new project.</li>\r\n\t<li>Go to the Common folder and copy paste everything to your primary project's Common folder.</li>\r\n\t<li>Now open up the newly pasted Common\\StandardStyles.xaml and copy paste all of your previously created custom DataTemplate from your old copy.</li>\r\n\t<li>Go to <a href=\"http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/shair/about.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Shair Raiten's</a> excellent guide to upgrade Metro apps from Beta to RC <a href=\"http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/shair/archive/2012/06/03/upgrade-metro-app-from-beta-to-rc.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>As you can see, there are a number of changes to naming conventions for classes, XAML styles and static class methods.

Microsoft is getting it right over time but they don't really like early adopters. They make us bleed with the current <strong>BREAKING</strong> changes with Visual Studio 2012 and offering us only white papers that I don't like to read. This is done with even the Microsoft Indonesia dev team is not aware of. A sad fact but it's true.\r\n\r\nHowever, I got help from Pak Risman, Microsoft Indonesia's Developer &amp; Platform Director. He taught me the right way to do things with codes, this is something I'd understand.\r\n\r\nTo wrap things up, I'll be submitting the app to Windows Store soon and hopefully satisfy the QA team over at Microsoft.

Bayes Classifier - Revisited","slug":"naive-bayes-classifier-revisited","markdown":"During the last week, I've been following up work with a side project to do machine learning with Urbanesia's comprehensive data. A lot of late night reading and fiddling with foreign codes were the highlights of my last week. Wanted to elaborate my implementations and how several kinds of technologies affect benchmarks particularly with classification performance.\r\n\r\nThe repo for the codes is at Github <a title=\"Simple Naive Bayes Classifier for PHP\" href=\"https://github.com/tistaharahap/Simple-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-for-PHP\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nDuring time span of the first batch of codes until now, I have made lots of changes to the codes and also the data store. I wasn't sure at first, which database will bring the best performance. I'm testing on a fairly low spec hardware which is a Macbook Air Late 2011 with 4 GB DDR3, SSD and Intel Core i5 1.7GHz, this is nothing compared to a real server relatively. By the way, although relatively low spec, she's got a name, it's <strong>Claire</strong>.\r\n\r\nMy first challenge was to abstract data stores and deal with the algorithm later. To keep things familiar and easy, MySQL was the first store I dealt with. After getting the tables ready, I coded the algorithm with help from <a href=\"http://bionicspirit.com/pages/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">Alexandru Nedelcu</a>'s excellent <a href=\"http://bionicspirit.com/blog/2012/02/09/howto-build-naive-bayes-classifier.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hacker News posting to implement Naive Bayes Classifier in Ruby</a>. The alpha version was produced.\r\n\r\nThe alpha sucks really bad in terms of performance, it took +1000 seconds to classify a single word. MySQL was expectedly not up for the task. Since the data is actually a collection of words, I was intrigued to use MongoDB as the data store. Since the abstraction layer is already there, I wrote a MongoDB store quite painless and hoping to get better results. The codes were done and the benchmark showed with MongoDB, it only took +400 seconds to classify a single word. Still not good enough, I wasn't prepared to write scheduled backend services which will explode the servers with +50.000 users at least and not to mention the 200.000+ businesses we have, it's gonna be a Sys Admin's nightmare.\r\n\r\nReal work was catching up with side projects so I decided to take a break until last week, I managed to get some time to write more codes. So I read along Hacker News to look for the perfect NoSQL database to work with the data we have. I remembered a friend of mine <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dondyb\" target=\"_blank\">Dondy Bappedyanto</a> talking about Redis and how it is a superset of Memcache. So I went straight to <a href=\"http://redis.io\" target=\"_blank\">Redis.io</a> and compiled the source code.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I knew the algorithm wasn't optimized as I would have liked it to be with the MySQL and MongoDB store, wanted to focus on macro optimizations and do micro optimizations afterwards.\r\n\r\nRedis is quite unique because it's <em>\"Memcache-like\"</em> storing data as key values, the logic changes dramatically and further learning of Redis' data types will help a lot. My aim was to study Redis while doing the project so I opted to do the codes with primitive data types first and optimize along the way. So with a lousy algorithm and a not-so-optimized data model in Redis, I classfied a keyword and it was instant love. It only took ~1 second to do it.\r\n\r\nSo in my mind, I already got the optimization I wanted on a macro level, it's time to get dirty now. Being my nature of enjoying new stuffs as they come up, I researched other implementations of Naive Bayes Classifier in other languages. I was thinking about implementing a <a href=\"http://nodejs.org\" target=\"_blank\">Node.js</a> + <a href=\"http://socket.io\" target=\"_blank\">Socket.io</a> proxy to do the JavaScript communication with our V2 client side codings and was interested to know more about Node.js.\r\n\r\nA quick google introduced me to several Node.js modules to do the job. One that I was particularly interested was <a href=\"https://github.com/harthur/classifier\" target=\"_blank\">Classifier</a> by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/harthvader\" target=\"_blank\">Heather Arhur</a>. I read through the source code and finding some clever methods to speed up things, get all the data first and do the calculations afterwards. But, I was curious about Node.js and wanted to learn to code with it. So I did a more optimized of my previous algorithm in PHP and implemented it in JavaScript. Wanted to know how my codes will perform against the Classifier Node.js module. Both codes were using Redis as the data store.\r\n\r\nThe quick answer is that both my codes and the Classifier module achieved sub second performance, classifying single keywords in ~300Â milliseconds. This was a great morale boost but the fun only lasted a while. It turns out that sometimes both implementations won't spit out results in medium to large datasets. Being a newbie with Node.js, I didn't know what to do. My guess it's got something to do with memory because the both implementions didn't emit the finish events. Could be a Node.js problem or rather the redis and hiredis node modules.\r\n\r\nThis makes me code in PHP again. Heavily modified the implementation in PHP to get the data first and calculate later. I was surprised with the result. It took only ~0.01 second to classify a single keyword after the optimization was done. This gives me an idea to do the calculation in PHP and using Node.js + Socket.io as a frontend to JavaScript clients.\r\n\r\nSince it was really painless to do WebScoket with Socket.io, it took only a few minutes to produce the Node.js frontend available <a href=\"https://github.com/tistaharahap/nbc-nodejs-php\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. During a subjective benchmark, it took 68 milliseconds to classify and deliver the result to JavaScript clients. This was a near realtime result and I found my solution.\r\n\r\nLast night was full with fiddling around with the algorithm, trying to get the best accuracy from it and during last night and today, the PHP implementation is now at <a href=\"https://github.com/tistaharahap/Simple-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-for-PHP/tags\" target=\"_blank\">version 0.3.0</a>. A coding session this afternoon led to a helper to produce blacklist/stopwords from a collection of text. I couldn't just import the most frequent words to the blacklist collection because it's really subjective depending on languages. Urbanesia's data is a mix of Indonesian and English so it will take more time to analyze. If there's an acceptable automation method, I will share it at the repo.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this project was to think less and do more. Algorithms to do machine learning is available through out the Internet, I mean smart and talented developers before and after us will keep finding new ways to organize data, it's the implementation that counts. Each problems has its own domain and I'm sure my codes will not cater all problems. However, learning by doing is also an excellent experience.\r\n\r\nNaive Bayes Classifier is a probability calculation of each keyword being independent to the other keywords classified so it's really suited to mine preferences, related content, etc but in some cases when a group of keyword is actually what we want to know about, Naive Bayes Classifier's accuracy won't be so great. This calls for another solution, if you have any ideas about this, please do comment, would love to know what you think.\r\n\r\nCheers!","html":"<p>During the last week, I've been following up work with a side project to do machine learning with Urbanesia's comprehensive data.

This was a near realtime result and I found my solution.</p>\n\n<p>Last night was full with fiddling around with the algorithm, trying to get the best accuracy from it and during last night and today, the PHP implementation is now at <a href=\"https://github.com/tistaharahap/Simple-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-for-PHP/tags\" target=\"_blank\">version 0.3.0</a>. A coding session this afternoon led to a helper to produce blacklist/stopwords from a collection of text. I couldn't just import the most frequent words to the blacklist collection because it's really subjective depending on languages. Urbanesia's data is a mix of Indonesian and English so it will take more time to analyze. If there's an acceptable automation method, I will share it at the repo.</p>\n\n<p>The conclusion of this project was to think less and do more. Algorithms to do machine learning is available through out the Internet, I mean smart and talented developers before and after us will keep finding new ways to organize data, it's the implementation that counts. Each problems has its own domain and I'm sure my codes will not cater all problems. However, learning by doing is also an excellent experience.</p>\n\n<p>Naive Bayes Classifier is a probability calculation of each keyword being independent to the other keywords classified so it's really suited to mine preferences, related content, etc but in some cases when a group of keyword is actually what we want to know about, Naive Bayes Classifier's accuracy won't be so great. This calls for another solution, if you have any ideas about this, please do comment, would love to know what you think.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1387126098374,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1387126098374,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1350411989000,"published_by":1},{"id":176,"uuid":"380f47ac-c031-48d9-9ef6-3b34cf3c5ab3","title":"chuck-norris-php","slug":"chuck-norris-php","markdown":"It is what is - A PHP client to get Chuck Norris from The Internet Chuck Norris Database: <a href=\"http://icndb.com\" target=\"_blank\">icndb.com</a>.\r\n\r\nCodes at the usual -Â <a title=\"chuck-norris-php\" href=\"https://github.com/tistaharahap/chuck-norris-php\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/tistaharahap/chuck-norris-php</a>\r\n\r\nChuck will come after you...you have been warned!","html":"<p>It is what is - A PHP client to get Chuck Norris from The Internet Chuck Norris Database: <a href=\"http://icndb.com\" target=\"_blank\">icndb.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Codes at the usual -Â <a title=\"chuck-norris-php\" href=\"https://github.com/tistaharahap/chuck-norris-php\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/tistaharahap/chuck-norris-php</a></p>\n\n<p>Chuck will come after you...you have been warned!</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1387126098379,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1387126098379,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1352513981000,"published_by":1},{"id":177,"uuid":"6228862e-ed2d-43f8-857d-6a5fe4d628a2","title":"Compiling nginx 1.4.0 With SPDY on CentOS 6","slug":"compiling-nginx-1-4-0-with-spdy-on-centos-6","markdown":"Just a few days ago, the latest version of <a title=\"nginx\" href=\"http://nginx.org\" target=\"_blank\">nginx</a> at 1.4.0 was released to the public.

It's simple to be done in less than 5 minutes but also deceptive enough to filter script kiddies.\r\n\r\n<code>1 2 * 3 4 5 * 6 7 * 8 9 10 * 11 12 * 13 14 15 * 16 17...1000</code>\r\n\r\nThe puzzle quiz is to code that specific pattern in various languages. Let's start from the most inefficient way of doing it in PHP.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5825378.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nThe codes above will yield a correct pattern. To make it interesting, let's redo the code with the least lines of code possible like below.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5825425.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nThere is something else we can do to further optimize this piece of code. Instead of using 2 variables, let's just use 1.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5825561.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nOk now that we've got the most efficient logic to recreate the pattern, let's try indulging ourselves into various languages. Let's start off with JavaScript.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5825597.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nThere's not much difference in the syntax as we compare it with the PHP codes right? Time for some <a href=\"http://coffeescript.org\" target=\"_blank\">CoffeeScript</a> below.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5825979.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nConsider the JavaScript equivalent of the above CoffeeScript code generated from CoffeeScript in-browser compiler:\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5825996.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nFrom the example above, subjectively I feel the CoffeeScript code is more beautiful to comprehend. Its support for <a href=\"http://coffeescript.org/#loops\" target=\"_blank\">Array Comprehension</a> makes the code equivalent to a mathematic expression and the operators available in CoffeeScript is there to be read like reading plain English.\r\n\r\nHowever as you can see the resulting JavaScript codes, it uses more variables and more lines of code. Browsers will have to download more bytes. Since <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/gzip\" target=\"_blank\">GZIP compression for web pages</a> is available in most modern browsers and daemons, sacrificing bytes for clarity I believe will save development time in the future. Again, this is subjectively speaking, your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nLet's venture into another language, Python.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5826164.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nMy first impression after doing the codes above is the codes were like New Year's day. It's old and new at the same time. So let's spice it a little bit to adhere with <a href=\"http://lukasz.langa.pl/8/single-dispatch-generic-functions/\" target=\"_blank\">PEP443 - Single Dispatch Generic Functions</a>.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5829056.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nNow the code got more lines, more variables but if you noticed, it's a lot more readable (verbose) and ready to be extended if deemed necessary.

Immediately triggered my interest to question how secure top websites in Indonesia when it comes to their SSL.\r\n\r\n<h3>Urbanesia</h3>\r\nSince I am at Urbanesia, the first goto is clear. Typed in Urbanesia.com and the initial audit result was needs more work.\r\n\r\nSo the audit results came back as a <strong>B</strong>. The server didn't mitigate BEAST attack and that's the main reason the grade was dropped. After a little digging up, the ciphers were the culprit and to mitigate the problem, nginx needs to be configured like below.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5871541.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nAs it turs out, after putting the configuration at play, Urbanesia was still getting a B due to BEAST non-mitigation. The resources out there implies the above configuration so I'll have to settle for B until further digging.\r\n\r\n<h3>Top Websites</h3>\r\n\r\nSo I was curious how other websites in Indonesia grades.

above says, it's quite the risky business for E-Commerce consumers in Indonesia. <a href=\"http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries;2/ID\" target=\"_blank\">Bhinneka ranking 58</a> according to Alexa.com scores an <strong>F</strong>. Tiket.com is using an older set of daemon/SSL Ciphers, they need to harden while Tiket2 needs to buy an SSL certificate. Other E-Commerce websites like TokoBagus, Disdus and Berniaga doesn't even support SSL.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, websites scoring an A were mostly banks which are KlikBCA, Bank Mandiri and CIMB. Applause for Lazada for also scoring an A.\r\n\r\nWhat I found most disappointing were payment gateways except for Veritrans. Veritrans implements a rather secure API mimicking OAuth's flow requiring all requests to be signed with a secret key, they also scored a B.\r\n\r\niPaymu was scoring a B but after going through their <a href=\"https://ipaymu.com/dokumentasi-api\" target=\"_blank\">API Documentation</a>, it was appalling to say the least. All of the requests to their API doesn't need any public/private token pair, in fact just a plain token. Definitely needs more attention to their security practice.\r\n\r\nFor Doku and Finpay, I don't know their API endpoints if any but a check to their root domain names yield disappointing results as well. Doku does not support SSL while Finpay has an SSL certificate mismatch. Not what you expected from a payment gateway. I'm out of <code>-(superlatives)</code> for these two. Midazz is pretty much exactly like Doku, they don't understand the needs for SSL.\r\n\r\nAirlines have the worst SSL audit of all the other websites. Lion Air and Air Asia got a C while Garuda Indonesia got an F! Airlines especially Garuda Indonesia needs to find better resources in securing their customer's transactions on their websites. <strong>Totally unacceptable!</strong> How can you pay hundreds of millions of dollars on airplanes and fail miserably at this?\r\n\r\nSo there you go, Top Indonesia websites awareness for SSL.","html":"<p>I came across <a title=\"Qualys SSL Labs\" href=\"http://www.ssllabs.com\" target=\"_blank\">Qualys SSL Labs</a> a few minutes ago while reading through Hacker News. Immediately triggered my interest to question how secure top websites in Indonesia when it comes to their SSL.</p>\n\n<h3>Urbanesia</h3>  \n\n<p>Since I am at Urbanesia, the first goto is clear. Typed in Urbanesia.com and the initial audit result was needs more work.</p>\n\n<p>So the audit results came back as a <strong>B</strong>. The server didn't mitigate BEAST attack and that's the main reason the grade was dropped. After a little digging up, the ciphers were the culprit and to mitigate the problem, nginx needs to be configured like below.</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5871541.js\"></script>\n\n<p>As it turs out, after putting the configuration at play, Urbanesia was still getting a B due to BEAST non-mitigation. The resources out there implies the above configuration so I'll have to settle for B until further digging.</p>\n\n<h3>Top Websites</h3>\n\n<p>So I was curious how other websites in Indonesia grades.

It was 4 AM and I am moving this blog over to <a href=\"http://www.cloudkilat.com\" target=\"_blank\">CloudKilat</a>. Already got the MySQL dump transferred, would need to have the whole site rsync-ed to the new server. So I did it. Without me realizing, I misplaced the source and destination ending up the new server's home directory rsync-ed to the original server. A fundamental mistake.\r\n\r\nLuckily, as I said above, the MySQL dump is already safe at hand so to rebuild another Wordpress blog would be a matter of configurations.\r\n\r\nFrom what I read across the web, Wordpress is relatively easier to scale and having only a single core at work, I will need to scale this blog properly. I haven't though. As of this writing, I have only set up <code>nginx + php-fpm + APC</code>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a for fun project, nothing too serious, most will be proof of concepts. Some tricks were absorbed when scaling <a href=\"http://www.urbanesia.com\" target=\"_blank\">Urbanesia's</a> frontend, <a href=\"http://dailysocial.net\" target=\"_blank\">DailySocial</a> and <a href=\"http://www.trenologi.com\" target=\"_blank\">Trenologi's</a> WordPress installation.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm planning to do is to prepare the blog by scaling minimally only on what's needed. This CloudKilat VM is packed with 2 GB of memory so it's spacious enough to run a minimal dynamic web server with MySQL in it. However, I am not getting that illusion of speed even though CloudKilat is here in Indonesia. The web server is curl-ing post pages at 11 seconds. Way too much overhead there.\r\n\r\nThe specs are as follow:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>1 CPU Core</li>\r\n\t<li>2 GB RAM</li>\r\n\t<li>20 GB Hard Drive</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.nginx.org\" target=\"_blank\">nginx</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.php.net\" target=\"_blank\">PHP-FPM</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/\" target=\"_blank\">MariaDB 5.5</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.redis.io\" target=\"_blank\">Redis 2.6.14</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.memcached.org\" target=\"_blank\">Memcached 1.4.15</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com\" target=\"_blank\">CloudFlare</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>First Look</h3>\r\n\r\nInitial assessment shows that the server is not capable of handling high loads without some special tunings. I am also testing CloudFlare with this server and when it's cached, the response time is great. On the dynamic side, the server is lagging to spit out HTML as fas as it can. Execution time to render an HTML can be as long as 6 seconds. Unacceptable at all.\r\n\r\nSince this is a VM and <code>root</code> access is a given, I'm starting off by removing all unnecessary services below:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Apache httpd</li>\r\n\t<li>Sendmail</li>\r\n\t<li>Samba</li>\r\n\t<li>Bind</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI never want to have <code>sendmail</code> to be installed by default on any of my servers. Spammers know what their doing and will surely take advantage of unsecure <code>sendmail</code> installations.\r\n\r\n<h3>Dumb Cache</h3>\r\n\r\nSo the first easiest thing to do is hack WordPress' <code>index.php</code> file and add my own code to do caching with Memcached. What I want to do is cache every dynamically generated pages into memory, purge cache if I make any changes and hook with WordPress' output to do this.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, I don't need to hook with WordPress' output, I just need to hook into PHP's <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/book.outcontrol.php\" target=\"_blank\">output buffering</a> mechanism. The codes below is a rather crude way of doing it.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5905509.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nThe problem with the code above is that I can't refresh by will let's say if I had to make an Edit on one of my blog posts. So a line with code needs to be adjusted, specifically line 9 to be:\r\n\r\n<code>$cache = !empty($_GET['refresh']) && $_GET['refresh'] == 'waku' ?

Everything does happen for a reason ;)","html":"<p>Just a few days ago, an accident happened. It was 4 AM and I am moving this blog over to <a href=\"http://www.cloudkilat.com\" target=\"_blank\">CloudKilat</a>. Already got the MySQL dump transferred, would need to have the whole site rsync-ed to the new server. So I did it. Without me realizing, I misplaced the source and destination ending up the new server's home directory rsync-ed to the original server. A fundamental mistake.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, as I said above, the MySQL dump is already safe at hand so to rebuild another Wordpress blog would be a matter of configurations.</p>\n\n<p>From what I read across the web, Wordpress is relatively easier to scale and having only a single core at work, I will need to scale this blog properly. I haven't though. As of this writing, I have only set up <code>nginx + php-fpm + APC</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a for fun project, nothing too serious, most will be proof of concepts. Some tricks were absorbed when scaling <a href=\"http://www.urbanesia.com\" target=\"_blank\">Urbanesia's</a> frontend, <a href=\"http://dailysocial.net\" target=\"_blank\">DailySocial</a> and <a href=\"http://www.trenologi.com\" target=\"_blank\">Trenologi's</a> WordPress installation.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm planning to do is to prepare the blog by scaling minimally only on what's needed. This CloudKilat VM is packed with 2 GB of memory so it's spacious enough to run a minimal dynamic web server with MySQL in it. However, I am not getting that illusion of speed even though CloudKilat is here in Indonesia. The web server is curl-ing post pages at 11 seconds. Way too much overhead there.</p>\n\n<p>The specs are as follow:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n    <li>1 CPU Core</li>\n    <li>2 GB RAM</li>\n    <li>20 GB Hard Drive</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.nginx.org\" target=\"_blank\">nginx</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.php.net\" target=\"_blank\">PHP-FPM</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/\" target=\"_blank\">MariaDB 5.5</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.redis.io\" target=\"_blank\">Redis 2.6.14</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.memcached.org\" target=\"_blank\">Memcached 1.4.15</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com\" target=\"_blank\">CloudFlare</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>First Look</h3>\n\n<p>Initial assessment shows that the server is not capable of handling high loads without some special tunings. I am also testing CloudFlare with this server and when it's cached, the response time is great. On the dynamic side, the server is lagging to spit out HTML as fas as it can. Execution time to render an HTML can be as long as 6 seconds. Unacceptable at all.</p>\n\n<p>Since this is a VM and <code>root</code> access is a given, I'm starting off by removing all unnecessary services below:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n    <li>Apache httpd</li>\n    <li>Sendmail</li>\n    <li>Samba</li>\n    <li>Bind</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I never want to have <code>sendmail</code> to be installed by default on any of my servers. Spammers know what their doing and will surely take advantage of unsecure <code>sendmail</code> installations.</p>\n\n<h3>Dumb Cache</h3>\n\n<p>So the first easiest thing to do is hack WordPress' <code>index.php</code> file and add my own code to do caching with Memcached. What I want to do is cache every dynamically generated pages into memory, purge cache if I make any changes and hook with WordPress' output to do this.</p>\n\n<p>As it turns out, I don't need to hook with WordPress' output, I just need to hook into PHP's <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/book.outcontrol.php\" target=\"_blank\">output buffering</a> mechanism. The codes below is a rather crude way of doing it.</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5905509.js\"></script>\n\n<p>The problem with the code above is that I can't refresh by will let's say if I had to make an Edit on one of my blog posts. So a line with code needs to be adjusted, specifically line 9 to be:</p>\n\n<p><code>$cache = !empty($<em>GET['refresh']) &amp;&amp; $</em>GET['refresh'] == 'waku' ? FALSE : $mem->get($key);</code></p>\n\n<p>The final code becomes below.</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/5905530.js\"></script>\n\n<p>Execution time goes as fast as <code>0.00081706047058105 second</code> and it's exactly what I'm after. Haven't really diagnosed any problems with the codes yet.</p>\n\n<h3>Moral of The Story</h3>\n\n<p>I accidentally deleted my blog and ended up hacking Wordpress to my taste.

With Adsense, essentially everywhere you go on the Internet, you are followed by it. Almost any website with ads I visited were serving them from Adsense. It is annoying! Not because of the nature of being served ads but because of being served the same ads over and over.\r\n\r\nMy first reaction when I began realizing how annoying this has been was to figure how Adsense can pull something like this. The amount of data that would need to be analyzed at run time is just huge and I'm sure that's still an understatement. Technically, this is one of the better feats of how technology on the internet is growing and implemented like never before. I mean, just a few years ago, Big Data isn't as cool as it is today, back then terms like Data Warehouse is more common. Sounded more like SDLC while in college: Obsolete and enterprisey.\r\n\r\nBut then again no matter how great an engineering feat it is, it's still annoying.\r\n\r\nFacebook is as equally annoying as Adsense. It's basically serving me ads while I am at Facebook.com with ads that are repetitively boring. I can appreciate the level of engineering needs to be done to achieve this but still I am not a product, I am a human being. So this post is me being human versus an army of ads machines.\r\n\r\nI have a pretty good example. I first heard about <a href=\"http://www.digitalocean.com\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Ocean</a> from an article at Hacker News comparing Cloud providers. When I visited their website, I was sold instantly. A cheap SSD cloud VM with enough spec for me for only  a fixed US$ 5/month. At that time I still have 2 <a href=\"http://www.rackspace.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rackspace</a> cloud VMs costing me about US$ 40/month. So for 2 cloud VMs, I would only spend US$ 10/month at Digital Ocean.\r\n\r\nInstantly I signed up and was blown away by how fast they can provision a VM. Their promise was 55 seconds to provision a new VM and the promise is good. My VM was ready in less than 55 seconds by the way. When I was able to login to the newly created VM, I instantly check their I/O performance.\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/out.img bs=8k count=512k\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe result was <code>120 MB/s</code> which is ~20 MB/s faster than the SSD I'm using in my Macbook right now.\r\n\r\nJust tonight when I was Facebook-ing, I noticed an ad on the right sidebar. The ad was about Digital Ocean. Now almost every time I log on to Facebook, the Digital Ocean ad mostly reveal itself. I was thinking to myself, I was already blown away by the I/O benchmark, why keep trying to win me over? I am already your customer. \r\n\r\nTo see Digital Ocean's ad makes me annoyed more than Adsense. Other than I'm already their customer, it's because the algorithm for Facebook ads doesn't even care about me already as Digital Ocean's customer. The algorithm figures out that I'm into those things, offer me ads about those things and sell my eyeballs to the highest bidder.\r\n\r\nNow comes Adsense. I just watched some videos on YouTube about airplanes and I love airplanes. You know what ad is shown? It's <a href=\"http://www.mailgun.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mailgun</a>. I have visited Rackspace and Mailgun's website before and was sold to Rackspace but definitely not sold with Mailgun. I have my reasons about Mailgun.\r\n\r\nSo why do I kept being served ads from Mailgun when in honest truth, I don't wanna be their customer. I am already very happy with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ses/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon SES</a>.\r\n\r\nI wasn't signed in into YouTube so I figured the recent privacy policy changes Google made us agree to a few months ago must be enabling this to happen. Google knows who I am as long as I have signed in to any of their services. I don't like this at all. Not just because my profile is essentially public within Google's web properties but why offer me ads from Mailgun which their services I have no interest at all.\r\n\r\nOn a contextual level, yes the algorithm works to know what I am in to but it failed miserably to detect that my past visit to Mailgun didn't end up with me as their customer. So stop serving me those ads.\r\n\r\nAnother case with both Facebook and Adsense is <a href=\"http://www.newrelic.com\" target=\"_blank\">New Relic</a>. I have just signed up for a free account there to trial how easy can my life be if New Relic can help me analyze codes and performance hickups by just the most simple steps.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I am a New Relic customer. Very happy with the T-shirt they sent out to free. Their product is also really awesome. I have a dashboard that is enabling me to measure performance easily. They also have an API that I can query for more specific needs. It's great.\r\n\r\nSince I became New Relic's customer both Facebook and Google served me all their inventories about New relic almost all the time. I got bored by the tagline \"Nerd's Life\" because it popped in all New Relic ads be it in Facebook or Google. Why do I have to be served more ads like this, why not serve me ads about something else like where I wanna spend my honeymoon later with my wife to be?\r\n\r\nThis made me rethink the whole strategy of serving ads to users. Ads is the most successful internet business model to generate revenue. But instead of second guessing what my interest are, why not just ask me?\r\n\r\nI am more than willing to increase their Click Through Rate so long as the ads are relevant and current to me. The context of me liking anything geeky is just not enough to serve me geeky ads. I am still a human being, I like to go out, travel and do more stuffs than just how my profile look to Facebook and Google.\r\n\r\nFacebook and Google hasn't even introduce who they are to me personally, so why act like they know me? I know from first hand experience that context is the most important element to serve content, I appreciate it. However, the data is not rich enough to stop me being annoyed by the same ads over and over.\r\n\r\nThey say consistency is a recipe for success but for the cases I mentioned above, consistency consistently makes me block my brain for ad spots. Whenever I see ads, I look for any <code>[X]</code> button to hide them and hopefully permanent.\r\n\r\nNever really liked ads but I'm totally not against ads, I just hope the ads served are more relevant than like just saying: \"<em>oh yes I know that guy, he's a geek.</em>\". Why not do a: \"<em>Of course, Tista is already a customer for New Relic and Digital Ocean, he doesn't really like Mailgun so let's take a chance to serve him ads about travelling.

Throughout most of the years, there is only 1 thing staying consistent: hunger. Call it a hunger to better myself in more ways mostly personally which impacts directly into my professional life.\r\n\r\nMy first intro to programming was as early as my first instinct to get to know how to speak English. Subtitles in past TV serials helped me a lot and my Grandparents, they talked in English sometimes but mostly left me to figure it out on my own. That was the first time I learned by myself how to understand a foreign language.\r\n\r\nWhen a BASIC interpreter showed up if I don't have my DOS disk with me, it tickles me. Found a book about Apple BASIC my dad bought only to realize that it's not the same BASIC interpreter I saw. I struggled learning 2 languages, English and BASIC. Finally was able to do a \"Hello World\" and life took a different direction.\r\n\r\nI tore down the 8088 XT I had and tried to figure out which is which. It cost me the PC itself, I broke it accidentally, can't remember which got broken. There was a PC Expo and my Grandpa bought me a Pentium 120 MHz with 32 MB of RAM and 1 GB of hard drive. That was the first device I had capable of internet access with a 14.4 kbps modem.\r\n\r\nMy first MP3 download happened right there too, it was Eric Clapton's \"Change The World\". During that time, I was amazed with HTML. So I signed up for a free website at Geocities. My first website was there.\r\n\r\nI saw an opportunity. Before I continue, I confess I downloaded pirated music and make profits from it. \r\n\r\nMy friends liked the content I had so they kinda asked me to download some more which I did. Was lucky enough in high school, I got Cable TV and Internet. When I first signed up, the speed was 512 Kbps although they downgraded all the subscribers to 128 Kbps after a while.\r\n\r\nMP3 was full of fun. I love music and I play a few instruments so I downloaded much more. At the time, my music collection is as rich as it can be. As long as I can find the MP3s on the internet, I have it. I started selling mixed tapes, literally, not CDs but an actual tape cassettes. It was analog so you can imagine how unscalable the business is.\r\n\r\nI sold for Rp. 10.000 per 60 minutes mixed tape cassettes. The margin was more than enough for me have happy weekends at the time. And then my PC got upgraded to a Pentium 4, her name was Gia. I was the only person with a CD Writer in school. So I upgraded to selling CDs. Christmas was full of joy, I sold more. Most of the sales were Christmas Carols and religious songs.\r\n\r\nI learned that vertical/themed contents can sell for more than the usual price. I sold them at Rp. 20.000 - 25.000 depending on who my customer is. Back then I was just plain stupid, the money was made for fun and the lessons I learned was again for the fun of it.\r\n\r\nAfter a long conversation tonight with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/apiperdana\" title=\"Api Perdana\" target=\"_blank\">Api Perdana</a> at <a href=\"http://www.lokanantaresto.com/\" title=\"Lokananta Terrace Resto\" target=\"_blank\">Lokananta</a>, I came to find what's been missing in my head for the last few years.\r\n\r\nThe missing thing was: <strong>The Unknown</strong>.\r\n\r\nI was always great in dealing with uncertainties, doubts and jumping head first. Just a right dose The Unknown made me learned all the knowledge I have right now, enabling me to create. \r\n\r\nThe other thing I realized is that I am a soloist. Back in college, I can't talk about codes or any other geeky stuffs with my own college friends. I was majoring in Computer Science & Mathematics, a double degree. So nerds and geeks are all there but their not who I want to talk to when it comes to geeky stuffs like the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux or even how to code a classic Nokia Snake game using Linked Lists. There was no passion, just an endless pursue of grades before midterms or finals.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rampok\" title=\"Rama Mamuaya\" target=\"_blank\">Rama</a> reminded me of who I am as a soloist a few years back and I don't get him at the time. I only knew Rama for a few months at the time but he saw right through me, you should get to know the guy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, every life decision comes from how well we exploit The Unknown right? So it's fair to say that I settled for what I needed rather than what I really want back then.\r\n\r\nWise men will say I made a sound choice but it's just not me. Tried so hard to be someone you're not and got lost in middle of it all. There are responsibilities for every choice so it's about being responsible to myself I told me.\r\n\r\nSo it's about one last effort to create once more. Whether the shit hit the tanks or even though it will skyrocket, I must call it a day soon. In a few months, time will tell.\r\n\r\nFor me, success is defined by 2 simple things <strong>Good Food and Enough Sleep</strong>. I can't ask for more than those 2 really, it's all I ever really wanted. As a side effect of the success, catering the needs and wants of as many people as possible is the short term goal.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of The Unknown, I am venturing into something I have no knowledge about. In high school, I once got 3 out of 10 grade in my trimester report card in Accounting. I really hate accounting, I don't want to know how much other people or company is making, I don't care and it cost me a year of my teenage life.\r\n\r\nNot about accounting in specific but more about finance and investments. The long talk with Api tonight gave a lot of perspective of how Stock Trading works. In essence, as a developer, I saw a potential of adding context and value into dull stock quotes data.\r\n\r\nI build websites and is accustomed by the discipline to see things from the user's perspective. There are 3 things highly successful websites (once startups) do:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Creating a platform enabling its own users to give value to the collective's data</li>\r\n<li>Let machines learn about the data and give value to it by modelling previous learnings (The Real World)</li>\r\n<li>The combination of the 2 above</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSo I am challenging myself to create something from the vast amount of data available from the Stock Trading market. I will need to learn about a lot of how the analyst, traders and investors think while crafting the end product. The ideal way is to have the knowledge in advance but where's the fun in learning without doing? I want to get my fingers busy.\r\n\r\nStill have no specific concept for a product but as I go along, gonna be documenting the effort here in my blog. I find that writing about things I learned before strengthen my understanding about the topic. Our brain is very much analytical.\r\n\r\nMy next blog post will likely be with screenshots or other conceptual thinking visuals. The weakest and also the strongest part of a developer is always their curiosity, it'll be fun to exploit my own way of thinking.","html":"<p>Over the years, a lot has changed since I first venture into making opportunities available for myself.

Bought a Nexus One to develop some apps with it. Nowadays, Android has gone a long way but still, most fundamentals to make your apps snappy still applies. I'm going down memory lane to post some of the optimizations producing effective and efficient codes.\r\n\r\n<h2>Static Method &amp; Properties</h2>\r\n\r\nLike in any platform, memory is the key to performance. The better we utilize memory, the better the performance. With Android, utilizing memory is as simple as defining the right static class properties and methods. When you set a static property or method, it will always be referenced once at run time. Hence, all the references are already in the memory before you call any of them.\r\n\r\nI usually have a <code>Utils</code> class defined with all my Android apps. Every property and method are static. Android comes with a pretty handy <code>Log</code> class to log to <code>stdout</code>. The first parameter for most of the methods is a String tag.

With every new Android release, Google updates their <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Android Support Library</a> to include certain UI Components needing backward compatibilities. Of all the latest UI components I used, only the <code>ActionBar</code> component is still needing other alternative (hint: <a href=\"http://actionbarsherlock.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ActionBarSherlock</a>).\r\n\r\nNative UI components offer you consistent codes throughout all Android versions meaning that you can worry more about what your app do than what versions of Android support component X. This is fresh air for developers, thanks to Google for making lives easier.\r\n\r\nHere are a few Native UI Components I used before with Android Support Library:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fragments</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation-drawer.html\" target=\"_blank\">NavigationDrawer</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/view/ViewPager.html\" target=\"_blank\">ViewPager</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>AsyncTask</h2>\r\n\r\nFor any task that your codes do that will block the UI in any way, delegate to <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html\" target=\"_blank\">AsyncTask</a></code>. With every subclass, you can always override <code>onPreExecute()</code> and <code>onPostExecute</code> to meddle the UI a bit before and after your task is executed.\r\n\r\nI have a few tutorials here for that matter:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/blog/2011/android-asynctask-is-a-beauty-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/blog/2011/android-asynctask-is-a-beauty-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Final Words</h2>\r\n\r\nSo to wrap things up, by adhering to these design patterns when developing on Android, I always get that speedy and snappy Android app illusion for users. Speed like in web development is an expensive illusion but you can pay it by doing some vertical scaling. It's hard to scale horizontally because Android devices hardware is on the mercy of manufacturers.","html":"<p>The first time I coded for Android was with Eclair (2.1). Bought a Nexus One to develop some apps with it. Nowadays, Android has gone a long way but still, most fundamentals to make your apps snappy still applies. I'm going down memory lane to post some of the optimizations producing effective and efficient codes.</p>\n\n<h2>Static Method &amp; Properties</h2>\n\n<p>Like in any platform, memory is the key to performance. The better we utilize memory, the better the performance. With Android, utilizing memory is as simple as defining the right static class properties and methods. When you set a static property or method, it will always be referenced once at run time. Hence, all the references are already in the memory before you call any of them.</p>\n\n<p>I usually have a <code>Utils</code> class defined with all my Android apps. Every property and method are static. Android comes with a pretty handy <code>Log</code> class to log to <code>stdout</code>. The first parameter for most of the methods is a String tag. It gets in the way for me. So here's an example.</p>\n\n<pre lang=\"java\">  \npublic class Utils {  \n    public static String TAG = \"APP_NAME\";\n    public static void logger(String msg) {\n        Log.v(TAG, msg);\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n\n<h2>Interface (Listeners)</h2>\n\n<p>When I first learned about Java Interfaces, I fell in love at first sight.

It basically takes a file from your <a href=\"http://db.tt/W6ASvpmz\" target=\"_blank\">DropBox</a> or <a href=\"http://drive.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google Drive</a> account and sell them. Payments are made using <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\" target=\"_blank\">PayPal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stock Quotes on the Google Play Store is a lite version that is enabled only to keep track 1 stock symbol. While the full version does not have any restrictions. The full version is sold at US$ 5 minimal, you could pay more though. Sell Box HQ enables a donation feature enabling sellers like myself to set a minimal price.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some screenshots.  </p>\n\n<p>  \n<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot_2013-07-29-23-13-46.png\"><img src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot_2013-07-29-23-13-46-180x300.png\" alt=\"Welcome\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1069\" /></a>  \n<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot_2013-07-29-23-14-08.png\"><img src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot_2013-07-29-23-14-08-180x300.png\" alt=\"AAPL\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1073\" /></a>  \n<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot_2013-07-29-23-14-19.png\"><img src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screenshot_2013-07-29-23-14-19-180x300.png\" alt=\"Reminder\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1076\" /></a>  \n</p>\n\n<p>Downloads:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bango.stockquotes\" target=\"_blank\">Lite Version</a></li>  \n<li><a href=\"https://sellboxhq.com/l/A6LL/Stock-Quotes-Android-App\" target=\"_blank\">Full Version</a></li>  \n</ul>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1387126098446,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1387126098446,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1375144817000,"published_by":1},{"id":194,"uuid":"2d8395a0-0fdb-4891-a317-0701490c151a","title":"Cheap Ideas are Cheapest to Create","slug":"cheap-ideas-are-cheapest-to-create","markdown":"I had 2 lunches today.

Known as the destination for Indonesians to try their luck, during this holiday season, Jakarta is pretty much \"empty\". So I set out to do an experiment, one that will inform me of how much I'm saving in fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nI have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Freed\" target=\"_blank\">2009 Honda Freed</a>, people say that it's the best bang for the buck when it comes to MPVs. I can attest to that. Anyways, I started the week by filling the gas tank full of its 42 Liters capacity. The cost was Rp. 260.000 + Rp. 19.000 equaling <strong>Rp. 279.000</strong>.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering why there were 2 cost variations it was because I filled the gas tanks with different octane levels. 40 Liters of Pertamina Premium fuel (88 RON) and 2 Liters of Shell Super fuel (92 RON). The octane ratings were sourced from Wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The fuel tank capacity for Honda Freed is 42 Liters sourced from <a href=\"http://www.reviewtalks.com/post/Honda-Freed-MPV-review.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nAs of today, my fuel efficiency registers at 11,8 KM/liter meaning that I could get 495 KM before the gas tank is empty. Just a week before, I got 9 KM/liter meaning there's a difference of 2,8 KM/L.

Known as the destination for Indonesians to try their luck, during this holiday season, Jakarta is pretty much \"empty\". So I set out to do an experiment, one that will inform me of how much I'm saving in fossil fuels.</p>\n\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Freed\" target=\"_blank\">2009 Honda Freed</a>, people say that it's the best bang for the buck when it comes to MPVs. I can attest to that. Anyways, I started the week by filling the gas tank full of its 42 Liters capacity. The cost was Rp. 260.000 + Rp. 19.000 equaling <strong>Rp. 279.000</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If you're wondering why there were 2 cost variations it was because I filled the gas tanks with different octane levels. 40 Liters of Pertamina Premium fuel (88 RON) and 2 Liters of Shell Super fuel (92 RON). The octane ratings were sourced from Wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The fuel tank capacity for Honda Freed is 42 Liters sourced from <a href=\"http://www.reviewtalks.com/post/Honda-Freed-MPV-review.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As of today, my fuel efficiency registers at 11,8 KM/liter meaning that I could get 495 KM before the gas tank is empty. Just a week before, I got 9 KM/liter meaning there's a difference of 2,8 KM/L. The week before the fuel tank was 42 Liters of Shell Super.</p>\n\n<p>Looking from the numbers above, with the current configuration (mix) of fuels and add that with light traffic during the holidays season, I am travelling 495 KM as opposed to last week's 378 KM.

While I was searching, I noticed there's a banner displayed on top of the page, it was definitely not Urbanesia's and so I got curious.\r\n\r\nWhen digging into the mobile web source code, we didn't activated any codes that'll lead to any banner placements on top so this banner must surely be injected by a third party. My mind were full of technical ideas translating into security breaches/flaws making the injection a reality.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we didn't use any JavaScript library on our mobile web, it was all pure JavaScript. All the JavaScript and CSS the website needed were embedded into the HTML. The website is very light and yet it took a relatively extended period of time to load on my Nexus 4. So I switched to opening it with my Z10 and it loaded as fast as I expected it to be. There wasn't any banner, I was using a Telkomsel 3G connection on my Z10.\r\n\r\nSo the culprit is XL definitely since they also took the time to display their logo on the banner. Here's a screenshot.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/xl-ads-urb.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/xl-ads-urb-180x300.jpg\" alt=\"XL Ads\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1104\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is most definitely a low blow by XL. They're practically monetizing using our content and also displaying ads on a 3G connection I already paid for. For both the content provider and user, this is a very unethical and disgraceful act to say the least.\r\n\r\nMy blog post here will talk more about the technicalities on how XL is able to do this. I won't be 100% correct but I'll settle for 99%.\r\n\r\nXL's technique has a flaw. Try refreshing Urbanesia's mobile web and soon you'll notice that in some cases, it will show code fragments instead of the website. Why? Urbanesia's mobile uses Google Analytics server side implementation to track our statistics. By doing so, we have a small <code>ga.php</code> on our server to track users. Here are the codes below.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/6871276.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nThe script displays a small 1x1 GIF file and I made some modifications to only track users and not bots. Now instead of showing the GIF file, it showed code fragments. They mistakenly thought the <code>ga.php</code> file for a document when in fact it's an image. The <code>Content-Type</code> was correct as <code>image/gif</code> but I think they filter by looking at its file extension. Here's the screenshot.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/xl-ads-codes.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/xl-ads-codes-180x300.jpg\" alt=\"XL Codes\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1106\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere were some JavaScript URLs there so I went on to download the JavaScript file. The file is only downloadable if you're on their 3G network. They have a minified and obfuscated version named <code>ibn_complete_20130930.min.js</code> and a more readable version named <code>ibn_complete_20130930.js</code>. Here's a Github Gist of the readable version: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/6837508\" title=\"ibn_complete_20130930.js\" target=\"_blank\">https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/6837508</a>.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that they included their development and production URLs intact within the source code. They also included jQuery with the codes. When looking at the codes, they were only doing minimal DOM manipulation using jQuery and yet the bloated user's download size with the whole source code.\r\n\r\nSo my attention went into the JavaScript file they served. To disable the ad serving mechanism, I thought I can just nullify any requests to their ad servers URLs. So I tried to do so <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/6871441\" title=\"Anti XL Ads\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. It didn't work which gets me even more curious. This leaves me only 1 option, to debug straight into my Nexus 4 by following the instructions from Google <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging\" title=\"Remote Chrome Android Debugging\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nWhat got me more pissed off than before, I found out that Urbanesia's content was served as an <code>IFRAME</code> inside their HTML document. There were placeholders for top, left, right and bottom banners. But if you see the screenshots above, the domain of the website is still Urbanesia's. So basically XL did not only modified contents, they also manipulate users into believing that the ads are coming from Urbanesia's server. This disgusts me.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/xl-htmls.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/xl-htmls-300x121.jpg\" alt=\"xl-htmls\" width=\"300\" height=\"121\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1107\" /></a>\r\n\r\nYou see above, it's ridiculously inappropriate at all. Urbanesia did not consent to anything like this at all nor there were any notifications to our part about their practices. This is just wrong.\r\n\r\nMy tweets were responded by friends in the startup community and also from outside the community. The responds were in Facebook, I'm auto posting tweets to Facebook by the way. I can't represent them as this blog post is my personal thoughts but suffice to say, my thoughts are not much different than theirs.\r\n\r\nSo whether you're a content provider or a user, we are both offended by this kind of practice by XL. The big boys said that they are writing a protest letter to XL, let's see how this can stop XL from violating our rights. Yes we live in Indonesia which gets me even more pissed off. If you wanna help, retweet this blog post and let more people know.\r\n\r\n<strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: While I work at Urbanesia, this blog post is my personal thoughts and therefore does not imply the views of Urbanesia as an entity.","html":"<p>Last Friday, October 4th 2013 I was hanging out with some friends and while searching for a place to do so, I opened up Urbanesia on it mobile web <a href=\"http://m.urbanesia.com/\" title=\"Urbanesia\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.urbanesia.com/</a>.

So basically XL did not only modified contents, they also manipulate users into believing that the ads are coming from Urbanesia's server. This disgusts me.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/xl-htmls.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/xl-htmls-300x121.jpg\" alt=\"xl-htmls\" width=\"300\" height=\"121\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1107\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>You see above, it's ridiculously inappropriate at all. Urbanesia did not consent to anything like this at all nor there were any notifications to our part about their practices. This is just wrong.</p>\n\n<p>My tweets were responded by friends in the startup community and also from outside the community. The responds were in Facebook, I'm auto posting tweets to Facebook by the way. I can't represent them as this blog post is my personal thoughts but suffice to say, my thoughts are not much different than theirs.</p>\n\n<p>So whether you're a content provider or a user, we are both offended by this kind of practice by XL. The big boys said that they are writing a protest letter to XL, let's see how this can stop XL from violating our rights. Yes we live in Indonesia which gets me even more pissed off. If you wanna help, retweet this blog post and let more people know.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: While I work at Urbanesia, this blog post is my personal thoughts and therefore does not imply the views of Urbanesia as an entity.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1387126098465,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1387126098465,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1381192315000,"published_by":1},{"id":201,"uuid":"887a2b79-673e-4ab3-b4f7-d73f6ddb647d","title":"XL Content Modifying Ads - Part 2","slug":"xl-content-modifying-ads-part-2","markdown":"My tweets and <a href=\"http://www.bango29.com/go/blog/2013/xl-intrusive-content-modifying-banner-in-mobile-websites\" target=\"_blank\">the previous post</a> have gone viral.

I got it from Ebay for US$ 58. Long story short, I now have the most powerful remote control for 10 Watts.\n\n![My Brand New Cubieboard](/content/images/2013/Dec/img1.jpg)\n\nTo top it up, I created a DIY case from the foam provided on the package.\n\n![DIY Cubieboard Case](/content/images/2013/Dec/img2.jpg)\n\n## Installing Lubuntu into NAND\n\nI don't have a micro-SD card handy right now so I scoured the Internet on how get Linux running in it without a micro-SD card. Turns out, I can install easily into the NAND provided.\n\n**Warnings**\n\n* Things can get messy if you screw up your NAND, it is the only things separating you from a 58 bucks brick. ALWAYS use quality USB OTG cable.\n* Please use a quality USB Power Adapter. If you are planning to use the SATA Port or wireless keyboard/mouse, make sure you are using a **5V/2A** rated adapters. Otherwise, you may encounter weird behaviors.\n* I'm using a Mac OS X 10.9.1 so the instructions below applies for it\n\n### Pre Requisites\n\nNow that you are warned, here are the tools needed:\n\n* [Livesuit Mac](http://ubuntuone.com/7GLnElgM41yoGLZfRKxXzk)\n* [Lubuntu 12.05](http://ubuntuone.com/1o40LKTwzzhOrgFPBjrrHr)\n\nHere are some notes for the Lubuntu I'm installing taken from [here](http://docs.cubieboard.org/tutorials/a10-cubieboard_lubuntu_desktop_releases):\n\n* While Ethernet cable is not plugged in, It will take a long time to boot \nbecause of waiting DHCP timeout.\n* First time boot will re-size the partitions automatically.\n* With the clean version, you may apt-get install mysql-server failed, \nbecause of the permission issue. To solve it, just add mysql user to inet group.\n\n### Flashing to NAND\n\nNow this is the easy part should the above are all satisfied.\n\n* Open up Livesuit\n* Click on the **Image** icon on the top left hand corner\n* Browse to the Lubuntu image you've downloaded\n* Plug the USB OTG cable to your Mac's USB Port\n* On your Cubieboard, find the mini-USB port and under it there will be a small button labeled [FEL](http://linux-sunxi.org/FEL).\n* Press the button, do not release untill Livesuit reacts and connect the mini-USB end to the Cubieboard\n* Livesuit should start to flash after asking you if you want to format the partitions or not\n\n![Livesuit Flashing to NAND](/content/images/2013/Dec/img3.jpg)\n\nWhen the flashing is done, unplug the OSB OTG port from either the devices and now you have a working Lubuntu install. The first time you boot the OS, it will take longer than usual. The first boot will actually resize the NAND partition automatically and install additional DEBs.\n\n![Half Naked Cubieboard](/content/images/2013/Dec/img5.jpg)\n\n### Logging In First Time\n\nYou know what, I only have a wireless mouse attached to the Cubieboard. Didn't have any spare keyboard so it became tricky to login into the GUI. I opened up my router's web frontend and looked for the IP of the Cubieboard and got it. Here are some defaults for the accounts:\n\n* linaro / linaro\n* root / toor\n\n![Booting the Cubieboard](/content/images/2013/Dec/img4.jpg)\n\nI SSH'ed into the box, changed the default passwords and I'm in. There were some packages I would like to be there and here are the steps I took as `root`:\n\n<pre>$ apt-get update\n$ apt-get install -y vim build-essential screen aria2</pre>\n\nFor added security, I created my own user and added the user to the `admin` group. Here are some added steps:\n\n#### My Macbook\n\n<pre>$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub # Copy the output to clipboard</pre>\n\n#### Cubieboard Side\n<pre>$ adduser [new_user]\n$ passwd [new_user]\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa\n$ vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys # Paste into here\n$ chmod 600 authorized_keys</pre>\n\n### On Board Keyboard\n\nLubuntu comes featured with an On Board Keyboard but not available by default. Here are some steps to install it:\n\n<pre>$ apt-get install -y onboard</pre>\n\nNow when the keyboard is installed, the keyboard is always available through the menus.\n\n### Remote Desktop with VNC\n\nSince I didn't have a keyboard to play with, I thought why not meddle to get VNC working. I tried `Tight VNC Server`, `x11vnc` and `vino`. The first option worked perfectly.\n\n<pre>$ apt-get install -y tightvncserver lxde-common</pre>\n\nNow I want my user to have an `X` session so I did these:\n\n<pre>$ su [my_user] -\n$ vim .vnc/xstartup</pre>\n\nInsert the following lines:\n\n<pre>#!/bin/sh\n#export XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1\n#exec ck-launch-session startlxde &      #for an lxde session\nstartlubuntu &\nvncconfig -nowin &</pre>\n\nBack to the prompt:\n\n<pre>$ chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup\n$ vncpasswd # Enter your own Password\n$ vncserver -geometry 1200x600 :1</pre>\n\nYou should see some initialization messages. Login to the VNC session using your VNC client. I choose [Chicken of The VNC](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/).\n\n![VNC Session](/content/images/2013/Dec/Screen_Shot_2013_12_20_at_3_35_07_PM.png)\n\n### Mounting a SATA Harddrive\n\nI have a spare 120 Gigs SATA Drive so I plugged in into the Cubieboard. Be default, it is not mounted at boot time. Let's mount it and make it persistent through boots.\n\n<pre>$ mkdir -p /media/ext\n$ mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda1 # Format to ext4\n$ mount /dev/sda1 /media/ext</pre>\n\nNow try a `df -h` and it should output something like below.\n\n<pre>Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/nandc      993M  517M  433M  55% /\ntmpfs           405M   60K  405M   1% /tmp\n/dev/nandd      993M  402M  548M  43% /usr/lib\n/dev/nande      992M  477M  472M  51% /usr/share\n/dev/nandf      496M  285M  187M  61% /lib\nnone             81M  552K   81M   1% /run\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            405M     0  405M   0% /run/shm\nnone            100M   28K  100M   1% /run/user\n/dev/sda1       111G  6.1G   99G   6% /media/ext</pre>\n\nLet's make it persistent now.\n\n<pre>$ vim /etc/fstab</pre>\n\nAdd the below line.\n\n<pre>/dev/sda1\t/media/ext\text4\tdefaults\t0\t2</pre>\n\n### Swap File\n\nThe Lubuntu is installed without a swapfile, you can confirm this with:\n\n<pre>swapon -s</pre>\n\nThere will be nothing there. I added a swapfile for my experiment, I plan on installing various apps and memory shortage could be a problem. I'm putting the swapfile in my SATA harddrive.\n\n<pre>$ cd /media/ext\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/ext/swapfile bs=1024 count=2048k # This is for 2 gigs swapfile\n$ mkswap swapfile\n$ swapon swapfile</pre>\n\nNow check if the swapfile is mounted with `swapon -s` and it should output something like below.\n\n**Note**: I'm creating a 4 gigs swapfile\n\n<pre>Filename\t\t\t\tType\t\tSize\tUsed\tPriority\n/media/ext/swapfile                     file\t\t4194300\t164\t-1</pre>\n\nLet's make this persistent like so by adding the lines below to `/etc/fstab`.\n\n<pre>/media/ext/swapfile\tnone\tswap\tsw\t0\t0</pre>\n\n### Samba for Cross Platform File Sharing\n\nNow that I have a SATA harddrive running, I want the harddrive to be shared. It's trivial and here are the steps.\n\n<pre>$ apt-get install -y samba</pre>\n\nNext up, let's open up `/etc/samba/smb.conf` and add the following lines.\n\n<pre>[ext120gigs]\n   comment = Files here please\n   path = /media/ext\n   guest ok = yes\n   browseable = yes\n   create mask = 0775\n   directory mask = 0775\n   writeable = yes</pre>\n   \nNow restart samba.\n\n<pre>$ restart smbd</pre>\n\nYou can make authentication work with Samba but that's topic for another time. I want the shared drive to be available for anyone and for any gadgets without the fuss.\n\n## References\n\n* [Lubuntu Downloads](http://dl.cubieboard.org/software/a10-cubieboard/lubuntu/) - Do not flash the SD Card images, it won't work on Livesuit anyways\n* [Android Downloads](http://dl.cubieboard.org/software/a10-cubieboard/android/) - The 2.3 firmware I thinks is the better one although I feel the Android firmwares is not as I would expect.\n* [CyanogenMod Downloads](http://dl.cubieboard.org/software/a10-cubieboard/cyanogenmod/) - I don't recommend installing this, too bland.\n* [Tutorials for Cubieboard 1 - A10](http://docs.cubieboard.org/tutorials/cb1/start) - Highly recommended to go here first.\n* [Building your own Android TV Image for Cubieboard](http://linux-sunxi.org/Building_Android_TV_image)\n* [Building Android Jellybean for Cubieboard](http://linux-sunxi.org/Instruction_to_build_jellybean_for_cubieboard)\n* [How To Add Swap on Ubuntu 12.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-12-04)\n* [Installing a New Harddrive](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingANewHardDrive)\n\n## First Impressions\n\nSo far I've managed to flash a Lubuntu 12.10 build into my Cubieboard's NAND and configured the Lubuntu to fit my needs without a physical keyboard handy. I can also VNC into the box and have a SATA harddrive shared using Samba.\n\nThe performance of the Cubieboard itself is not great but sufficient. My next blog post will cover more about performance and stability. Until then.","html":"<p>Yesterday, my Cubieboard A10 board arrived, Yeay! I got it from Ebay for US$ 58.

The trouble is, the ISP I am with right now is blocking all incoming ports, needs a work around.\n\nAfter some browsing and also from past experiences, I feel `PPTP` is my best bet. Incredibly easy to implement from a client/server perspective. The challenge is to keep the tunnel open at all times.\n\nI'm using [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=2bac813f3a2d) to host the `PPTP` server and it so happens they already have a tutorial in their blog right [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-setup-your-own-vpn-with-pptp). I'm just customizing based on that blog post.\n\nThe VM is using Ubuntu 13.04 Server image.\n\n## PPTP Server Side\n\nThis is what I did on the server end.\n\n<pre>$ apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y # Optional\n$ apt-get install -y pptpd</pre>\n\n### Server & Client IP Allocations\n\nNow let's setup the IP Range we're gonna allocate to connecting clients. Add the lines below to `/etc/pptpd.conf`.\n\n<pre>localip 10.0.0.1\nremoteip 10.0.0.100-200</pre>\n\nThe `localip` part is for the server and the `remoteip` part is for connecting clients.\n\n### Defining Valid Users\n\nNext up we're gonna setup valid clients and allocate IP Addresses based on the user they are connecting as. Edit `/etc/ppp/chap-secrets` to reflect the followings.\n\n<pre>cubie pptpd cubie_secret 10.0.0.23</pre>\n\nWe can add as many users we want. If you don't want to assign static IPs, you can use the template below.\n\n<pre>john pptpd john_secret *</pre>\n\n### DNS for Clients\n\nThe lines below is using Google's DNS servers, if you have local DNS Servers, it will shorten round trips.\n\nGo ahead and edit `/etc/ppp/pptpd-options`.\n\n<pre>ms-dns 8.8.8.8\nms-dns 8.8.4.4</pre>\n\n### PPTPD Configuration Done\n\nRestart the daemon.\n\n<pre>service pptpd restart</pre>\n\n### Setting Up Forwarding & NAT\n\nFirst of all, we need to enable IP Forwarding. Go ahead and edit `/etc/sysctl.conf`.\n\n<pre>net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1</pre>\n\nLet's setup forwarding with `iptables` and let clients communicate with each other.\n\n<pre>$ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE && iptables-save\n$ iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface ppp0 -j MASQUERADE\niptables -I INPUT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -i ppp0 -j ACCEPT\niptables --append FORWARD --in-interface eth0 -j ACCEPT</pre>\n\n## Setting Up Cubieboard As a Client\n\nMy Cubieboard has a GUI set using `LXDE` but I want to do this from the CLI. I've also setup a small Python script to keep monitoring the VPN Tunnel.\n\n### Installing The PPTP Client\n\n<pre>$ apt-get install network-manager-pptp\n$ modprobe ppp_mppe</pre>\n\n### Configuring The PPTP Client\n\nThis is the easy part. Fire up an editor and create a new file: `/etc/ppp/peers/pptpserver`.\n\n<pre>pty \"pptp x.x.x.x --nolaunchpppd\"\nname cubie\npassword cubie_password\nremotename pptpserver\nrequire-mppe-128</pre>\n\nReplace the `x.x.x.x` line with the IP Address of your PPTPD Server. You can rename that particular `pptpserver` name to something more descriptive.\n\n### Connecting To The Server\n\nLet's connect now!\n\n<pre>$ pppd call pptpserver</pre>\n\nNow it won't show any logging, you can `tail` the log at `/var/log/syslog`.\n\n<pre>$ tail -f /var/log/syslog</pre>\n\nOr you can just check if `ppp0` is already available by doing a `ifconfig -s ppp0`. A successful connection will output something like below.\n\n<pre>Iface   MTU Met   RX-OK RX-ERR RX-DRP RX-OVR    TX-OK TX-ERR TX-DRP TX-OVR Flg\nppp0       1496 0         7      0      0 0             7      0      0      0 MOPRU</pre>\n\n### IP Routes\n\nLet's add some more routes like so.\n\n<pre>$ ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 dev ppp0</pre>\n\n## Making The VPN Tunnel Persistent\n\nWe need the tunnel to always be available at all times so we're gonna need a monitoring solution to reconnect when the tunnel is broken. I made a small Python script available below.\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/8059219.js\"></script>\n\nSave the file as `/root/bin/checkapp.py`, adjust permission and let's add this to our crontab.\n\n<pre>$ curl https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/8059219/raw/e3e8ac07308cc06e24694c182b09428901f36f9b/checkppp.py > /root/bin/checkapp.py\n$ chmod +x /root/bin/checkapp.py\n$ crontab -e</pre>\n\nAdd the following line below for a 5 minute check interval.\n\n<pre>*/5 * * * * /root/bin/checkapp.py</pre>\n\n## Done\n\nNow I have a persistent tunnel and available anytime I need it.","html":"<p>So after setting my Cubieboard for my liking, another thing I want is to be able to access it anywhere and anytime.

My Macbook has an SD Card reader but it's useless without the adapter.

Long story short, Android is Linux based with Java as its frontend exposed through its SDK. \n\nHowever, not everything is Java. Android has what it's called [Java Native Interface (JNI)](http://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-jni.html). So we can do things in Java, C/C++ and vice versa. Head on to [Android NDK](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html) for more info.\n\nThe part of Android I'm talking about is not necessarily about native C/C++ developments on Android. It's a nice to know knowldge to get a bigger picture of Android's internals. Here's a great Youtube video about the matter.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/MlxiQNijniQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Rooting Android\n\nThis part is for you to figure out. But, if you happen to be using a Nexus 4, you can go [here](http://nexus4root.com/nexus-4-root/how-to-root-nexus-4-windowsmac-osxlinuxubuntu/).\n\nRooting your phone is required in order to try out the codes.\n\n## Introducing Ngintipbot\n\nNgintipbot is an iconless (supposedly) Android app. Its main purpose is to monitor the items I would want to be monitored which are the items below.\n\n* Line - `root` required\n* Whatsapp - `root` required\n* Remote Upload of Data - `root` required\n* Call Recording - `root` required\n* SMS\n* Location\n* Phone Logs\n* Contacts\n* Remote Mic Activation\n\n### How Ngintipbot Works\n\nHere's a quick generals on how Ngintipbot works and how it doesn't.\n\n1. Install Ngintipbot's APK\n2. Run it with one of 2 ways, the icon from the launcher or a specific SMS format\n3. Eitherway, it will start Ngintipbot's Service and make it a `STICKY` service\n4. The service will create a `PendingIntent` which will set off `AlarmBroadcastReceiver` to be invoked every 1 hour\n5. When `AlarmBroadcastReceiver` is invoked, Ngintipbot will try to passively sense the device's current location\n6. After getting a lock on location, Ngintipbot will read contents from Line, Whatsapp and SMS, pack it and send the whole data to a `ngintipd` instance somewhere on the Internet\n\nAll of the juicy stuffs are at `Utils.java`. The methods to read contents from Line, Whatsapp and SMS are defined there.\n\n### The Main Activity\n\nThe main activity contains nothing. Consider it as a placeholder only.\n\n<script src=\"http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/tistaharahap/ngintipbot/blob/master/src/com/bango/ngintipbot/IntipbotActivity.java\"></script>\n\nThere's nothing there right? Why? A simple answer is because Activities does not have a predictable lifetime. You can't keep Activities to always run on the background. That's why most of the logic are delegated into Services.\n\n## Intipbot Service\n\nThis particular class interest is with stated before which is about starting the Service as a `STICKY` service. In particular is with the source code below.\n\n<script src=\"http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/tistaharahap/ngintipbot/blob/master/src/com/bango/ngintipbot/IntipbotService.java?slice=23:32\"></script>\n\nBy returning `Service.START_STICKY` we are simply making the Service to be constantly recreated if needed. A better explanation from Android's documentation is available [here](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html#START_STICKY).\n\n### Broadcast Receivers\n\nThe Service above is actually started from one of three possibilities which are a direct launch of the app, a specific SMS or when the device is booted. All of these are possible by registering a `BroadcastReceiver` into the manifest like below.\n\n<script src=\"http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/tistaharahap/ngintipbot/blob/master/AndroidManifest.xml?slice=37:42\"></script>\n\nThe receiver which is `StartupReceiver` simply triggers an `Intent` invocation to start `IntipbotService`.\n\n## Sensing Location\n\nI guess this is relatively the easy part. Tutorials to do this are plentiful so I won't talk much about this. My implementation after we get a lock on a location is where the more interesting action happens.\n\n<script src=\"http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/tistaharahap/ngintipbot/blob/master/src/com/bango/ngintipbot/Utils.java?slice=155:193\"></script>\n\n## Reading & Receiving SMS\n\nIn order for us to be able to read & receive SMSes, the app must declare the permission to do so.\n\n<script src=\"http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/tistaharahap/ngintipbot/blob/master/AndroidManifest.xml?slice=17:18\"></script>\n\n### Reading SMS\n\nI like `JSON` and this is why my implementation is actually read SMSes and convert them into `JSONArray`s which will then return its `String` representation to be `POST`ed later on.\n\n<script src=\"http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/tistaharahap/ngintipbot/blob/master/src/com/bango/ngintipbot/Utils.java?slice=42:69\"></script>\n\n### Receiving SMS\n\nThe current implementation doesn't actually parse the content of any SMS. It simply just invoke `StartupReceiver`. This can be a good after hours tinkering don't you think?\n\n## Privileged Process Running\n\nNext step is to gain privileged rights. I implemented this at `Utils.java` statically. There's nothing special about this. One thing to keep in mind is to do proper error parsing if it so happens the app didn't get privileged rights.\n\nMy implementation does not have that particular error management. Please do so.\n\n<script src=\"http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/tistaharahap/ngintipbot/blob/master/src/com/bango/ngintipbot/Utils.java?slice=118:153\"></script>\n\n## Reading Line & Whatsapp\n\nBoth of these apps are actually storing their message database in an `SQLite` flat file database. If you're interested in extracting the databases without the app, the path is below.\n\n* `/data/data/jp.naver.line.android/databases/naver_line*`\n* `/data/data/com.whatsapp/databases/msgstore*`\n\nNow with the app, I'm actually `tar`-ring the databases, create a directory called `.goog` on the SDCARD, upload to `ngintipd` and delete the `.goog` directory afterwards.\n\n<script src=\"http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/tistaharahap/ngintipbot/blob/master/src/com/bango/ngintipbot/Utils.java?slice=71:116\"></script>\n\n## ngintipd\n\nOkay __ngintip__ is Indonesian for peeking so it's only right to name the daemon `ngintipd`. As the name implies, this daemon is always ready to receive data from `Ngintipbot`. Written in Python and at the current development state, acts only as a storage. Further development should process `SQLite` databases and manipulate.\n\nAgain there are nothing special yet, it's basically a one file daemon.\n\n<script src=\"http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/tistaharahap/ngintipd/blob/master/ngintipd\"></script>\n\n## EOF\n\nThis concludes the talk. Codes and implementations are still minimum but I believe it's ready to be a foundation of something more ambitious so to speak.

This time, I wanna know how performant Cubieboard is. Benchmarks are configured in such a way to replicate a real Web Application.\n\n## Preparing\n\nHere are the specs for my Cubieboard:\n\n- AllWinner A10 ARM Single Core CPU\n- 1 GB DDR3 @ 480 MHz\n- 5V / 2A = 10 Watts\n- SATA HD - 5400 RPM\n- Cubian r7 - [http://cubian.org](http://cubian.org)\n- 2 GB Swapfile (SATA HD)\n- US$ 49\n\nI've written a tutorial on how to install Cubian to a SATA HD [here](http://bango29.com/cubieboard-part-3-sata-install-with-cubian/). The main reason why I'm doing a SATA HD Install for this is to preserve my micro-SD's lifetime. We're gonna be compiling and doing I/O intensive tasks so it's best to delegate off the micro-SD card.\n\nOther than preserving the micro-SD, these cheap ARM boards have limited I/O performances so a SATA 5400 RPM HD might be better but ultimately an SSD should be used because it's pitted against SSD opponents. I don't have a spare SSD so this will have to do.\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nThe Cubieboard is pitted against my Macbook Pro and [Digital Ocean's](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=2bac813f3a2d) lowest spec VM.\n\nA Macbook Pro will reflect how the Cubieboard perform compared with a typical development machine while the Digital Ocean VM is a real world server.\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: This is not an apple to apple comparison, please keep in mind that between the 3 systems there are gaps in specs. The benchmarks served here are good only for references.\n\n#### Macbook Pro\n\n- Early 2011\n- Dual Core i5 @ 2.3 GHz\n- 8 GB DDR3 @ 1333 MHz\n- SSD HD\n- OS X Mavericks 10.9.1\n- US$ 1199\n\n#### Digital Ocean\n\n- Single Core\n- 512 MB Memory\n- SSD HD\n- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n- 2 GB Swapfile\n- US$ 5/month\n\n### Compiler\n\nWe need to install a build system so that the Cubieboard will be able to do the benchmarks.\n\n```\n$ sudo -i\n$ apt-get install -y build-essential git gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf python-dev\n```\n\n## Redis\n\nSurprisingly the Cubieboard compiled [Redis](http://redis.io) successfully! I wasn't hoping much for this piece of hardware but then it's not just a toy, it's a full blown computer with a very small form factor.\n\n### Compile, Configure & Install\n\nFor this blog post, I'm compiling Redis 2.8.4. Let's go ahead.\n\n```\n$ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-2.8.4.tar.gz\n$ tar xfz redis-2.8.4.tar.gz\n$ cd redis-2.8.4\n$ make\n$ mkdir -p /usr/local/redis/bin\n$ mkdir -p /usr/local/redis/conf\n$ cp src/redis-{benchmark,check-aof,check-dump,cli,sentinel,server} /usr/local/redis/bin\n$ cp redis.conf /usr/local/redis/conf\n$ ln -s /usr/local/redis/bin/redis-{benchmark,check-aof,check-dump,cli,sentinel,server} /usr/local/bin/\n$ ln -s /usr/local/redis/conf/redis.conf /etc/redis.conf\n```\n\nNow that it's compiled and installed appropriately, let's go ahead and change some configurations to our needs.\n\n```\n$ vim /etc/redis.conf\n```\n\nUse/modify the file reflecting the below values and leave the rest on their default values.\n\n```\ndaemonize yes\nbind 127.0.0.1\n```\n\nNow let's start the server.\n\n```\n$ redis-server /etc/redis.conf\n```\n\n### redis-benchmark\n\n`redis-benchmark` comes with the Redis we will compile. It will basically benchmark throughputs for various Redis commands. The ones that I'm particularly interested are `GET`, `SET` and `INCR`. Those 3 are the commands I would normally used within a web application.\n\nFor this benchmark, I'm gonna test using 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 20 concurrent connections. The results are CSVs.\n\n```\n$ redis-benchmark -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -n 1000 --csv -c 1 > reds-bench-1.csv\n$ redis-benchmark -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -n 1000 --csv -c 2 > reds-bench-2.csv\n$ redis-benchmark -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -n 1000 --csv -c 3 > reds-bench-3.csv\n$ redis-benchmark -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -n 1000 --csv -c 4 > reds-bench-4.csv\n$ redis-benchmark -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -n 1000 --csv -c 8 > reds-bench-8.csv\n$ redis-benchmark -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -n 1000 --csv -c 20 > reds-bench-20.csv\n```\n\n#### Results\n\n##### Cubieboard\n\nThe higher the better.\n\n![Cubieboard Results](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=700x300&cht=bvg&chtt=Cubieboard&chd=s:svxz44,twx595,svxyzx&chco=00ff00,0000ff,ff0000&chdl=SET|GET|INCR&chxl=0:|c1|c2|c3|c4|c8|c20|1:|8196.72%20rps|&chxt=x,t,r)\n\n[Full Results CSV &raquo;](https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/8446289)\n\n##### Macbook Pro\n\nThe higher the better.\n\n![Macbook Pro Results](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=700x300&cht=bvg&chtt=Macbook%20Pro&chd=s:QYgr66,QWky49,QWdu69&chco=00ff00,0000ff,ff0000&chdl=SET|GET|INCR&chxl=0:|c1|c2|c3|c4|c8|c20|1:|45454.55%20rps|&chxt=x,t)\n\n[Full Results CSV &raquo;](https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/8446340)\n\n##### Digital Ocean\n\nThe higher the better.\n\n![Digital Ocean Results](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=700x300&cht=bvg&chtt=Digital%20Ocean&chd=s:gqsz41,fqvu90,jmr03z&chco=00ff00,0000ff,ff0000&chdl=SET|GET|INCR&chxl=0:|c1|c2|c3|c4|c5|c6|1:|28571.43%20rps|&chxt=x,t)\n\nFull Results CSV - Pending Upload\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThis benchmark stresses the raw CPU power of the device and its memory bandwidth. \n\nThe Cubieboard is obviously the under achiever which is expected.

It is performing at around 60% of my Macbook Pro's performance and only roughly 3 times as fast as my Cubieboard.\n\n### BayesRedis\n\nThis is a small Python library I developed to train and classify sets of text. It is available on Github [here](https://github.com/tistaharahap/python-bayes-redis). Installation for Cubieboard is a bit tricky because Cubian doesn't come with `pip` by default. We will have to install it manually.\n\n#### Installation\n\nFor your Cubieboard follow the steps below, other platforms may skip should you have `pip` already installed.\n\n```\n$ cd /usr/local/src\n$ wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-2.1.tar.gz#md5=2044725530450d0517393882dc4b7508\n$ tar xfz setuptools-2.1.tar.gz\n$ cd setuptools-2.1\n$ python setup.py install\n$ cd ..\n$ wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-1.5.tar.gz#md5=6969b8a8adc4c7f7c5eb1707118f0686\n$ tar xfz pip-1.5.tar.gz\n$ cd pip-1.5\n$ python setup.py install\n```\n\nBayesRedis is written in Python but upon installation it will be compiled natively. Here are the steps.\n\n```\n$ pip install redis hiredis bayesredis\n```\n\nIf you take a look at the Github repo, there's a `test.py` file at the root directory. I've made a Github Gist of the file so let's go ahead and customize it to our needs.\n\n```\n$ wget https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/8446592/raw/ac7350b7e7e17c07c7beff89affd7c3766633077/test.py\n$ vim test.py\n```\n\nAs you can see, the training examples are all commented out, for our first run we must uncomment them by removing the triple single quotes `'''` before and after the examples.\n\n#### Benchmarking\n\nNow let's run the benchmark.\n\n```\n$ redis-cli flushdb # This will truncate all your Redis data, use with care\n$ python test.py\n```\n\n#### Results\n\nThe lower the better.\n\n![BayesRedis Results](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=700x300&cht=bvg&chtt=Cubieboard&chd=s:jouz49,LNOQRS,JKKLMN&chco=00ff00,0000ff,ff0000&chdl=Cubieboard|Macbook%20Pro|Digital%20Ocean&chxl=0:|k1|k2|k3|k4|k5|k6|1:|0.00379%20second|2:|Keywords|&chxt=x,t,r)\n\nIf we see the chart above, Cubieboard is definitely miles apart. This particular benchmark stresses the memory bandwidth of the system. A wider memory bandwidth is key to this benchmark success.\n\nThis kind of benchmark is actually computed by servers everyday around the world. It's synthetic but it can explain how the real world would exploit the hardware beneath. \n\nA more familiar implementation example would be recommending you items to purchase by analyzing your purchase history.\n\nAs you can see, the Cubieboard is not ready for real world use by seeing the result of this benchmark. The Cubieboard is practically limited by its memory bandwidth.\n\n## nginx - Static Files\n\n[`nginx`](http://nginx.org) is on the rise right now. It's steadily dominating web servers around the world. The most obvious reason why nginx is so successful in simply because it's lightning fast.\n\nJust by reverse proxying traffic with nginx in front, I have seen at least 30% performance increase. The nature of handling requests asynchronously with a very lightweight memory footprint makes nginx the de facto choice for performance hungry websites.\n\n### Compile, Configure & Run\n\nFor this benchmark we only want to test synthetic raw performances. There are many factors in the real world that will influence a web server's perceived speed with network latency as the usual suspect.\n\nBenchmarks will be executed from another machine on the same network.\n\n#### Compile\n\nOur `nginx` installation is gonna be located at `/usr/local/nginx`. The only dependency we're gonna need is `libpcre3-dev`.\n\n```\n$ cd /usr/local/src\n$ wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.4.4.tar.gz\n$ tar xfz nginx-1.4.4.tar.gz\n$ cd nginx-1.4.4\n$ apt-get install -y libpcre3 libpcre3-dev\n$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/nginx\n$ make && make install\n```\n\n#### Configure & Run\n\nWe're gonna benchmark using only the default parameters of `nginx.conf`. As an addition, I want to benchmark image serving.\n\n```\n$ /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx -c /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf\n$ cd /usr/local/nginx/html\n$ wget http://nginx.org/nginx.gif\n```\n\nCheck if `nginx` is running by opening up a web browser and type in the IP of your Cubieboard.\n\n### Benchmark\n\nThis benchmark will be executed by 2 application which are:\n\n- [`ab`](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html) - Apache's benchmarking tool\n- [`wrk`](https://github.com/wg/wrk) - A rather modern evolution of HTTP benchmarking\n\n#### HTML\n\n```\n$ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://192.168.1.134/\n$ ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://192.168.1.134/\n$ ab -n 10000 -c 250 http://192.168.1.134/\n$ ab -n 10000 -c 500 http://192.168.1.134/\n$ ab -n 10000 -c 1000 http://192.168.1.134/\n$ wrk -r 10000 -t 1 -c 10 http://192.168.1.134/\n$ wrk -r 10000 -t 1 -c 100 http://192.168.1.134/\n$ wrk -r 10000 -t 1 -c 250 http://192.168.1.134/\n$ wrk -r 10000 -t 1 -c 500 http://192.168.1.134/\n$ wrk -r 10000 -t 1 -c 1000 http://192.168.1.134/\n```\n\n##### Results\n\nThe higher the better.\n\n![Cubieboard HTML Result](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=700x300&cht=bvg&chtt=Cubieboard%20HTML&chd=s:YomcM,AAAAT,wvz92,AAAFP&chco=00ff00,ff0000,0000ff,ff00ff&chdl=ab|ab%20err|wrk|wrk%20err&chxl=0:|c10|c100|c250|c500|c1000|1:|2639.39%20rps|&chxt=x,t)\n\nThe higher the better.\n\n![Macbook Pro HTML Result](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=700x300&cht=bvg&chtt=Macbook%20Pro%20HTML&chd=s:EGCCA,AAAmm,89655,AAABD&chco=00ff00,ff0000,0000ff,ff00ff&chdl=ab|ab%20err|wrk|wrk%20err&chxl=0:|c10|c100|c250|c500|c1000|1:|15981.36%20rps|&chxt=x,t)\n\nThe higher the better.\n\n![Digital Ocean HTML Result](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=700x300&cht=bvg&chtt=Digital%20Ocean%20HTML&chd=s:cfbXa,AAAAG,3942z,AAAAA&chco=00ff00,ff0000,0000ff,ff00ff&chdl=ab|ab%20err|wrk|wrk%20err&chxl=0:|c10|c100|c250|c500|c1000|1:|8347.89%20rps|&chxt=x,t)\n\n#### Image\n\n```\n$ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://192.168.1.134/nginx.gif\n$ ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://192.168.1.134/nginx.gif\n$ ab -n 10000 -c 250 http://192.168.1.134/nginx.gif\n$ ab -n 10000 -c 500 http://192.168.1.134/nginx.gif\n$ ab -n 10000 -c 1000 http://192.168.1.134/nginx.gif\n$ wrk -r 10000 -t 1 -c 10 http://192.168.1.134/nginx.gif\n$ wrk -r 10000 -t 1 -c 100 http://192.168.1.134/nginx.gif\n$ wrk -r 10000 -t 1 -c 250 http://192.168.1.134/nginx.gif\n$ wrk -r 10000 -t 1 -c 500 http://192.168.1.134/nginx.gif\n$ wrk -r 10000 -t 1 -c 1000 http://192.168.1.134/nginx.gif\n```\n\n##### Results\n\nThe higher the better.\n\n![Cubieboard Image Result](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=700x300&cht=bvg&chtt=Cubieboard%20Image&chd=s:PbacO,AAAAA,o9877,AAAEM&chco=00ff00,ff0000,0000ff,ff00ff&chdl=ab|ab%20err|wrk|wrk%20err&chxl=0:|c10|c100|c250|c500|c1000|1:|3907.59%20rps|&chxt=x,t)\n\nThe higher the better.\n\n![Macbook Pro Image Result](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=700x300&cht=bvg&chtt=Macbook%20Pro%20Image&chd=s:EIGBA,AAjjj,54595,AAABD&chco=00ff00,ff0000,0000ff,ff00ff&chdl=ab|ab%20err|wrk|wrk%20err&chxl=0:|c10|c100|c250|c500|c1000|1:|17491.20%20rps|&chxt=x,t)\n\nThe higher the better.\n\n![Digital Ocean Image Result](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=700x300&cht=bvg&chtt=Digital%20Ocean%20Image&chd=s:aecfU,AAAAH,15996,AAAAA&chco=00ff00,ff0000,0000ff,ff00ff&chdl=ab|ab%20err|wrk|wrk%20err&chxl=0:|c10|c100|c250|c500|c1000|1:|7876.61%20rps|&chxt=x,t)\n\n### Cubieboard as a Web Server\n\nThe results are in and Cubieboard proved a resilient piece of hardware. It is outperformed in every tests by its opponents but surprisingly when compared with my Macbook Pro, the Cubieboard is proving to be a reliable machine with fewer HTTP response errors.\n\nOS tuning is a factor why my Macbook Pro is spitting out lots of HTTP response errors. I tested as is without any OS tuning to my Macbook Pro and the other opponents. \n\nOn this benchmark my Macbook Pro is giving the highest throughput against the other opponents up until 250 concurrent connections when HTTP response errors are building up.\n\nThe Digital Ocean server stood very well only spitting out HTTPS response errors at 1000 concurrent connections. It's definitely a web server.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Cubieboard is great at handling CPU intensive tasks. Not so great when memory is vital to performance. I can see myself rigging a cluster of Cubieboards to do data science. And do it cheap with only 10 watts of power usage and US$ 49 price tag per board.\n\nA typical unbranded server here in Indonesia can cost upwards of US$ 1000 per server which amounts to 20 Cubieboards. When adding up the electricity costs of let's say a 450 Watts PSU, monthly usages is more cost efficient with a Cubieboard cluster.\n\nTo be fair, a Cubieboard configured as a server would at least cost US$ 49 + US$ 50 for a SATA HD - 5400 RPM. If SSD is an option, it could wind up to US$ 165 for a 64GB SSD totalling to US$ 224 per rig.\n\nAll and all, I am pleased with the benchmark results for my Cubieboard and in the future, I believe an ARM board such as the Cubieboard is performant enough and cost efficient to be a cluster of data science computing.","html":"<p>For the past month, I've been pleasantly hacking my Cubieboard to try out several different things.

I tested as is without any OS tuning to my Macbook Pro and the other opponents. </p>\n\n<p>On this benchmark my Macbook Pro is giving the highest throughput against the other opponents up until 250 concurrent connections when HTTP response errors are building up.</p>\n\n<p>The Digital Ocean server stood very well only spitting out HTTPS response errors at 1000 concurrent connections. It's definitely a web server.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>The Cubieboard is great at handling CPU intensive tasks. Not so great when memory is vital to performance. I can see myself rigging a cluster of Cubieboards to do data science. And do it cheap with only 10 watts of power usage and US$ 49 price tag per board.</p>\n\n<p>A typical unbranded server here in Indonesia can cost upwards of US$ 1000 per server which amounts to 20 Cubieboards. When adding up the electricity costs of let's say a 450 Watts PSU, monthly usages is more cost efficient with a Cubieboard cluster.</p>\n\n<p>To be fair, a Cubieboard configured as a server would at least cost US$ 49 + US$ 50 for a SATA HD - 5400 RPM. If SSD is an option, it could wind up to US$ 165 for a 64GB SSD totalling to US$ 224 per rig.</p>\n\n<p>All and all, I am pleased with the benchmark results for my Cubieboard and in the future, I believe an ARM board such as the Cubieboard is performant enough and cost efficient to be a cluster of data science computing.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1389826481220,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1389900936665,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1389900936684,"published_by":1},{"id":217,"uuid":"524f6fa3-17af-4373-85e2-fc52da2bf2f3","title":"Thank You, Urbanesia","slug":"thank-you-urbanesia","markdown":"So when joining Urbanesia on July 2010, [I wrote a blog post](http://bango29.com/hello-urbanesia/) about it.

I downloaded a copy of it before for my Macbook.\n\n## Constraints\n\nConstraints for the yet to built rig as follows.\n\n- Rp. 7.500.000 Max\n- Plenty of horse power for Video Editing\n- Large HD for rendered videos\n- Full HD support\n- Easy hardware upgrades\n\n## Specs\n\nAfter reading various topics about the right specs, I settled with the below specs.\n\n- Gigabyte GA-H77-DS3H\n- 1 x 8 GB DDR PC10600 DIMM\n- Intel Core i5 3330 - 3.0 GHz Quad Core\n- 500 GB SATA HD\n- 160 GB SATA HD\n- Digital Alliance Nvidia GT640 2 GB\n- Asus DVD-RW\n- Logitech USB Mouse/Keyboard\n- Dazumba 911 Tower ATX Case\n- Dazumba 450 Watts Pure PSU\n\nThe above spec costs **Rp. 7.450.000**.\n\nOne of the more difficult part was settling for the right CPU and Motherboard. Since it's meant as a Video Editing rig, the spec needs to be fast enough for memory, CPU and GPU intensive tasks.\n\nPrice being the utmost constraints I choose a Quad Core i5 3330 because it's the best bang for the buck. The Motherboard was cheap enough having a lot of room for upgrades. There are 4 DIMM slots, 6 SATA connectors and 2 full length PCIe slots.\n\nI only used 1 DIMM slot leaving 3 more for more memory to come. Dual Channel should increase memory bandwidth but that's something to trade off for a better price.\n\nThere is an unused PCIe full length slot which in the future will have a GPU attached to it. My brother in law wanted multi monitors so the extra PCIe slot is a plus.\n\nOpting for the GT640 GPU made life easier. Nvidia drivers for these GPUs are native. Minimal configuration needed.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo do an installation, you need an already working Mac setup. Here are links for the software you're gonna need:\n\n- [myHack 3.3.1](http://myhack.sojugarden.com/guide/)\n- [Mac OS X Mavericks from App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/os-x-mavericks/id675248567?mt=12)\n- [VoodooHDA 2.8.4](http://www.osx86.net/files/file/1194-voodoohda-2-8-4-pkg-installer/)\n- [Shailua ALXEthernet 1.0.2](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/284119-experimental-atheros-ar813132515261627172-driver-for-107108/)\n\nYou will also need a spare USB thumb drive or HDD for the install media.\n\n### Pre Installation\n\nRun the provided myHack application and follow instructions to create a bootable Mavericks install. Point myHack to the USB drive you prepped.\n\n### BIOS Settings\n\n- Legacy BIOS Boot\n- Save & Exit / Load Optimized Defaults\n- Peripherals / SATA Mode Selection - AHCI\n- BIOS Features / Intel Virtualization Technology - Disabled\n- BIOS Features / VT-d - Disabled\n\n### Install Mavericks\n\nPlug the USB drive to the rig and make it boot from it by pressing F12 at startup.\n\nYou have to boot with the following kernel arguments.\n\n```\n-v -f npci=0x3000 PCIRootUID=0 GraphicsEnabler=No\n```\n\nWith my USB Drive it booted straight into the installation process. When the mouse is available with a grey background, it will take a while until the language selection shows. Just wait for it.\n\n#### Format HD\n\nWhen the language selection shows up, click Utilities on the menu above and click Disk Utility. Make sure you select the right drive and format it as Mac OS X Journaled.\n\n### Post Installation\n\nmyHack will make the hard drive you installed it to bootable. So you can restart without worry. But you will still need to enter the boot flags above. Here are the boot flags for convenience.\n\n```\n-v -f npci=0x3000 PCIRootUID=0 GraphicsEnabler=No\n```\n\n#### Audio & Ethernet Kexts\n\nNow copy the kexts to your desktop. Run the following on a terminal window.\n\n```\n$ cd ~/Desktop\n$ sudo cp -R VoodooHDA.kext /System/Library/Extensions\n$ sudo cp -R ALXEthernet.kext /System/Library/Extensions\n$ sudo diskutil repairPermissions /\n$ sudo bless /System/Library/Extensions/\n```\n\n#### Chameleon Default Boot Options\n\nNext up we're going to configure Chameleon so we don't have to enter boot flags at boot time. On a terminal window, do the below.\n\n```\n$ sudo vim /Extra/org.chameleon.boot.plist\n```\n\nAdd/change to suit the line below.\n\n```\n<key>Kernel Flags</key>\n<string>npci=0x3000 PCIRootUID=0 GraphicsEnabler=No</string>\n```\n\nReboot.\n\n## Done\n\nNowadays building and installing a Hackintosh is a **lot** easier than in the early days. Anyone with the right curiosity will succeed.","html":"<p>A few weeks ago my brother in law asked me to help him build a Hackintosh rig. I obliged with the utmost curiosity.

I enjoy visiting DailySocial and reading about the Indonesian tech scene. But yet I've grown weary of filtering news to read. So why not hack a news classifier I thought.\n\n## Core Computing\n\nIt took 10 minutes to hack something up in Python. Why so fast you ask? Because text processing is second nature in Python. [NLTK](http://nltk.org/) is good but [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.org/) is great. I used a Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm provided by TextBlob. All I coded was a feature extractor catered to my likings.\n\nHere's the feature extractor.\n\n```\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\n \n \ndef feature_extractor(text):\n    if not isinstance(text, TextBlob):\n        text = TextBlob(text.lower())\n \n    feats = {\n        'has_rumor': 'rumor' in text.words,\n        'has_gosip': 'gosip' in text.words,\n        'has_pemasaran': 'pemasaran' in text.words,\n        'has_saham': 'saham' in text.words,\n        'has_hackathon': 'hackathon' in text.words,\n        'has_ipo': 'ipo' in text.words,\n        'has_akuisisi': 'akuisisi' in text.words,\n        'has_startup': 'startup' in text.words,\n        'has_android': 'android' in text.words,\n        'has_aplikasi': 'aplikasi' in text.words,\n        'has_payment': 'payment' in text.words,\n        'has_pembayaran': 'pembayaran' in text.words,\n        'has_api': 'api' in text.words,\n        'has_kompetisi': 'kompetisi' in text.words,\n        'has_ide': 'ide' in text.words,\n        'has_permainan': 'permainan' in text.words,\n        'has_game': 'game' in text.words,\n        'has_fundraising': 'fundraising' in text.words,\n        'has_askds': '[Ask@DailySocial]' in text.words,\n        'has_investasi': 'investasi' in text.words,\n        'has_akuisisi': 'akuisisi' in text.words,\n        'has_musik': 'musik' in text.words,\n        'has_bhinneka': 'bhinneka' in text.words,\n        'has_marketplace': 'marketplace' in text.words,\n        'has_mobile': 'mobile' in text.words\n    }\n    return feats\n```\n\n[Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/9167752)\n\nQuite simple isn't it? That's why I'm having a hard time filtering the news. Too much noise for my own interest.\n\nNow I need a train set so that the algorithm can be smart enough to figure out which story is interesting to me. There were discussions in my head whether to only parse only the article title or including the whole body. Long story short, I only settled for only the article title. If the title isn't concise enough then it's not interesting enough.\n\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nfrom text.classifiers import NaiveBayesClassifier\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\n \n \ndef feature_extractor(text):\n    if not isinstance(text, TextBlob):\n        text = TextBlob(text.lower())\n \n    feats = {\n        'has_rumor': 'rumor' in text.words,\n        'has_gosip': 'gosip' in text.words,\n        'has_pemasaran': 'pemasaran' in text.words,\n        'has_saham': 'saham' in text.words,\n        'has_hackathon': 'hackathon' in text.words,\n        'has_ipo': 'ipo' in text.words,\n        'has_akuisisi': 'akuisisi' in text.words,\n        'has_startup': 'startup' in text.words,\n        'has_android': 'android' in text.words,\n        'has_aplikasi': 'aplikasi' in text.words,\n        'has_payment': 'payment' in text.words,\n        'has_pembayaran': 'pembayaran' in text.words,\n        'has_api': 'api' in text.words,\n        'has_kompetisi': 'kompetisi' in text.words,\n        'has_ide': 'ide' in text.words,\n        'has_permainan': 'permainan' in text.words,\n        'has_game': 'game' in text.words,\n        'has_fundraising': 'fundraising' in text.words,\n        'has_askds': '[Ask@DailySocial]' in text.words,\n        'has_investasi': 'investasi' in text.words,\n        'has_akuisisi': 'akuisisi' in text.words,\n        'has_musik': 'musik' in text.words,\n        'has_bhinneka': 'bhinneka' in text.words,\n        'has_marketplace': 'marketplace' in text.words,\n        'has_mobile': 'mobile' in text.words\n    }\n    return feats\n \ntrain_set = [\n    ('Berbarengan dengan Launch Festival, Ice House Buka Kompetisi Wujudkan Ide-Ide Aplikasi Mobile.', 'ok'),\n    ('Ulang Tahun Ke-21, Layanan E-Commerce Bhinneka Segera Perbarui Platform E-Commerce dan Luncurkan Marketplace Terkurasi.', 'ko'),\n    ('Aplikasi Pencatat Blastnote Hadir di Android.', 'ok'),\n    ('Portal Hiburan Digital UZone Kini Hadir Dalam Versi Aplikasi Mobile.', 'ok'),\n    ('CTI IT Infrastructure Summit 2014 Bahas Big Data Sebagai Tren Teknologi', 'ko'),\n    ('Dua Berita Buruk Besar Bagi Blackberry', 'ok'),\n    ('Tanggapan Pelaku Industri Digital di Indonesia tentang Fenomena Permainan Mobile Flappy Bird', 'ok'),\n    ('[Ask@DailySocial] Proses Fundraising Untuk Startup', 'ok'),\n    ('Investasi $1 Miliar, Foxconn Pastikan Bangun Pabriknya di DKI Jakarta', 'ok'),\n    ('Raksasa Digital Cina Tencent Dikabarkan Akuisisi Portal Berita Okezone', 'ko'),\n    ('Wego Tawarkan Akses Reservasi Tiket dan Hotel Lebih Mudah Melalui Aplikasi Mobile', 'ok'),\n    ('Telkom Hadirkan Agen Wisata Online Hi Indonesia', 'ko'),\n    ('Meski Didera Isu Fake Likes, Facebook Tetap Jadi Pilihan Utama Untuk Pemasaran Digital', 'ok'),\n    ('Dave Morin Pastikan Saham Bakrie Global Group di Path Kurang dari 1%', 'ok'),\n    ('Kecil Kemungkinan Pemerintah Tutup Telkomsel dan Indosat Terkait Dugaan Penyadapan oleh Australia', 'ok'),\n    ('Kakao Dikabarkan Gelar Penawaran Saham Perdana Tahun Depan', 'ok'),\n    ('Ericsson Akan Hadirkan Layanan Streaming TV', 'ok'),\n    ('Ryu Kawano: Ingin Startup Anda Go Global?

The code is clear enough to show that I'm only extracting keywords. You can do a lot smarter by say including the length of the trained text. I'll leave that to the reader's imagination.\n\n## Integrating With DailySocial's Feed\n\nMachine Learning is an art. There's no one size fits all solution.

It's a set so what's in it is basically unique. More reading is [here](http://redis.io/topics/data-types).\n\n## Hacking Up a Frontend\n\nI want the frontend to be responsive and light. That canceled out [Bootstrap](#) and [Foundation](#) as options. I opted for [Micro RWD Grid](http://roybarber.github.io/micro-rwd-grid/) by [Row Barber](http://roybarber.com/). It's 32 lines of CSS.\n\nBut then I'm not a web designer, you are welcomed to design one.\n\nHere is the frontend: [DailySocial For ME!](http://ds-for-me.bango29.com).\n\n## Source Code\n\nSource code is available at [https://github.com/tistaharahap/ds-for-me](https://github.com/tistaharahap/ds-for-me).\n\nHack! \\m/","html":"<p><a href=\"http://dailysocial.net\">DailySocial.net</a> is a tech blog founded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rampok\">Rama Mamuaya</a>.  I enjoy visiting DailySocial and reading about the Indonesian tech scene. But yet I've grown weary of filtering news to read. So why not hack a news classifier I thought.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"corecomputing\">Core Computing</h2>\n\n<p>It took 10 minutes to hack something up in Python. Why so fast you ask? Because text processing is second nature in Python. <a href=\"http://nltk.org/\">NLTK</a> is good but <a href=\"https://textblob.readthedocs.org/\">TextBlob</a> is great. I used a Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm provided by TextBlob. All I coded was a feature extractor catered to my likings.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the feature extractor.</p>\n\n<pre><code>from textblob import TextBlob\n\n\ndef feature_extractor(text):  \n    if not isinstance(text, TextBlob):\n        text = TextBlob(text.lower())\n\n    feats = {\n        'has_rumor': 'rumor' in text.words,\n        'has_gosip': 'gosip' in text.words,\n        'has_pemasaran': 'pemasaran' in text.words,\n        'has_saham': 'saham' in text.words,\n        'has_hackathon': 'hackathon' in text.words,\n        'has_ipo': 'ipo' in text.words,\n        'has_akuisisi': 'akuisisi' in text.words,\n        'has_startup': 'startup' in text.words,\n        'has_android': 'android' in text.words,\n        'has_aplikasi': 'aplikasi' in text.words,\n        'has_payment': 'payment' in text.words,\n        'has_pembayaran': 'pembayaran' in text.words,\n        'has_api': 'api' in text.words,\n        'has_kompetisi': 'kompetisi' in text.words,\n        'has_ide': 'ide' in text.words,\n        'has_permainan': 'permainan' in text.words,\n        'has_game': 'game' in text.words,\n        'has_fundraising': 'fundraising' in text.words,\n        'has_askds': '[Ask@DailySocial]' in text.words,\n        'has_investasi': 'investasi' in text.words,\n        'has_akuisisi': 'akuisisi' in text.words,\n        'has_musik': 'musik' in text.words,\n        'has_bhinneka': 'bhinneka' in text.words,\n        'has_marketplace': 'marketplace' in text.words,\n        'has_mobile': 'mobile' in text.words\n    }\n    return feats\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/tistaharahap/9167752\">Github Gist</a></p>\n\n<p>Quite simple isn't it? That's why I'm having a hard time filtering the news. Too much noise for my own interest.</p>\n\n<p>Now I need a train set so that the algorithm can be smart enough to figure out which story is interesting to me. There were discussions in my head whether to only parse only the article title or including the whole body. Long story short, I only settled for only the article title. If the title isn't concise enough then it's not interesting enough.</p>\n\n<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nfrom text.classifiers import NaiveBayesClassifier  \nfrom textblob import TextBlob\n\n\ndef feature_extractor(text):  \n    if not isinstance(text, TextBlob):\n        text = TextBlob(text.lower())\n\n    feats = {\n        'has_rumor': 'rumor' in text.words,\n        'has_gosip': 'gosip' in text.words,\n        'has_pemasaran': 'pemasaran' in text.words,\n        'has_saham': 'saham' in text.words,\n        'has_hackathon': 'hackathon' in text.words,\n        'has_ipo': 'ipo' in text.words,\n        'has_akuisisi': 'akuisisi' in text.words,\n        'has_startup': 'startup' in text.words,\n        'has_android': 'android' in text.words,\n        'has_aplikasi': 'aplikasi' in text.words,\n        'has_payment': 'payment' in text.words,\n        'has_pembayaran': 'pembayaran' in text.words,\n        'has_api': 'api' in text.words,\n        'has_kompetisi': 'kompetisi' in text.words,\n        'has_ide': 'ide' in text.words,\n        'has_permainan': 'permainan' in text.words,\n        'has_game': 'game' in text.words,\n        'has_fundraising': 'fundraising' in text.words,\n        'has_askds': '[Ask@DailySocial]' in text.words,\n        'has_investasi': 'investasi' in text.words,\n        'has_akuisisi': 'akuisisi' in text.words,\n        'has_musik': 'musik' in text.words,\n        'has_bhinneka': 'bhinneka' in text.words,\n        'has_marketplace': 'marketplace' in text.words,\n        'has_mobile': 'mobile' in text.words\n    }\n    return feats\n\ntrain_set = [  \n    ('Berbarengan dengan Launch Festival, Ice House Buka Kompetisi Wujudkan Ide-Ide Aplikasi Mobile.', 'ok'),\n    ('Ulang Tahun Ke-21, Layanan E-Commerce Bhinneka Segera Perbarui Platform E-Commerce dan Luncurkan Marketplace Terkurasi.', 'ko'),\n    ('Aplikasi Pencatat Blastnote Hadir di Android.', 'ok'),\n    ('Portal Hiburan Digital UZone Kini Hadir Dalam Versi Aplikasi Mobile.', 'ok'),\n    ('CTI IT Infrastructure Summit 2014 Bahas Big Data Sebagai Tren Teknologi', 'ko'),\n    ('Dua Berita Buruk Besar Bagi Blackberry', 'ok'),\n    ('Tanggapan Pelaku Industri Digital di Indonesia tentang Fenomena Permainan Mobile Flappy Bird', 'ok'),\n    ('[Ask@DailySocial] Proses Fundraising Untuk Startup', 'ok'),\n    ('Investasi $1 Miliar, Foxconn Pastikan Bangun Pabriknya di DKI Jakarta', 'ok'),\n    ('Raksasa Digital Cina Tencent Dikabarkan Akuisisi Portal Berita Okezone', 'ko'),\n    ('Wego Tawarkan Akses Reservasi Tiket dan Hotel Lebih Mudah Melalui Aplikasi Mobile', 'ok'),\n    ('Telkom Hadirkan Agen Wisata Online Hi Indonesia', 'ko'),\n    ('Meski Didera Isu Fake Likes, Facebook Tetap Jadi Pilihan Utama Untuk Pemasaran Digital', 'ok'),\n    ('Dave Morin Pastikan Saham Bakrie Global Group di Path Kurang dari 1%', 'ok'),\n    ('Kecil Kemungkinan Pemerintah Tutup Telkomsel dan Indosat Terkait Dugaan Penyadapan oleh Australia', 'ok'),\n    ('Kakao Dikabarkan Gelar Penawaran Saham Perdana Tahun Depan', 'ok'),\n    ('Ericsson Akan Hadirkan Layanan Streaming TV', 'ok'),\n    ('Ryu Kawano: Ingin Startup Anda Go Global?

In other words, you can distribute data with 4 stripes onto 8 servers.\n\nAs a note: I'm doing this with 3 VMs installed with Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 1\n\nEdit `/etc/hosts` on **all the VMs**.\n\n```\n$ sudo vim /etc/hosts\n# Add Below\n192.168.23.1 bt1 # Node 1\n192.168.23.2 bt2 # Node 2\n192.168.23.3 bt3 # Node 3\n```\n\nCall the nodes whatever you want. Be sure to use the same exact names on all the VMs.\n\nOn each VMs, create directories to be distributed.\n\n```\n$ sudo mkdir /bt1 # bt1 for Node 1, bt2 for Node 2 and bt3 for Node 3\n```\n\n#### Step 2\n\nLet's install `glusterfs-server` on **all the VMs**.\n\n```\n$ apt-get install -y glusterfs-server\n```\n\nThe daemon will automatically be started after each installs.\n\n#### Step 3\n\nAfter all the VMs are installed, it's time to pick a VM as a leading role. For brevity, I'm using `bt1` or `192.168.23.1` as the leading VM.\n\n```\n$ sudo -i\n$ gluster peer probe bt2 # Adding Node 2 as peer\n$ gluster peer probe bt3 # Adding Node 3 as peer\n```\n\nNext up we're going to create a new volume.\n\n```\n$ sudo -i\n$ gluster create volume bt-vol stripe 3 bt1:/bt1 bt2:/bt2 bt3:/bt3\n```\n\nAs I said earlier I want to create a Distributed Stripe Volume. I would need to add 3 more peers/shares to expand the volume. \n\n**Why striping though?**\n\nFirst reason will be because I tried plain Distributed and it didn't work for some reason. The other reasons below:\n\n* More performance with more clients accessing the same volume\n* Little chunks of the same file are distributed on different peers so in my case the throughput triples (network/IO bound per VM) because the chunks are spread into 3 peers\n* If any of the peer experiences down time, data integrity is lost. I'm not too concerned because the data there are low value.\n\n#### Step 4\n\nAfter creating the volume, we would need to start and mount the volume.\n\n```\n$ sudo -i\n$ gluster volume start bt-vol\n$ mkdir -p /media/bt-vol\n$ mount.glusterfs bt1:/bt-vol /media/bt-vol\n```\n\nThere you have it. Check the mount point doing the below commands.\n\n```\n$ mount\nor\n$ df -h\n```\n\n---\n\n**What's next?**\n\nFor me it's simple. I want a Torrent downloader with a huge and flexible space I can shrink and expand anytime. I opted for `deluge-webui`. That's topic for another blog post.\n\nAnother idea is to use the replicating nature of `GlusterFS` and implement a highly available filesystem. This will work wonders for all kinds of use.

Just in time for Apple WWDC. I thought I was gonne be one of those late buyers who'll regret what they just bought when not very long, a \"better\" phone/hardware introduced. On the contrary, this was my most \"on time\" purchase of an iPhone ever.\n\nThese couple of years, I've limit myself from coding in iOS. I genuinely don't like Objective-C just like I don't like Ruby. My dislike doesn't mean I didn't try to at least a Hello World but each time I do it, it just reaffirms everything I don't like about Objective-C. No bashing is intended but I really think a top platform should have top tools.\n\nTake for example how well Microsoft treated their developer ecosystem by providing them with the best IDE I've tried so far: Visual Studio. I acknowledge that this is subjective but you should try building software with only Make files and a plain text editor. Visual Studio is expensive yes and I'm grateful for Bizspark.\n\nLast night when I was watching the WWDC keynote about Swift, it was like Deja Vu. A few years ago, Microsoft did the same with [WinRT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Runtime) and Windows 8. Excerpts from Wikipedia below:\n\n> Windows Runtime, or WinRT, is a platform-homogeneous application architecture on the Windows 8 operating system.

After asking that question in my head, more questions follow.\n\n1. Smells like Microsoft-esque vendor lock in?\n2. Is my resentment towards Objective-C is more on the framework or the language itself?\n3. Will coding in Swift save me more lines of codes like it did when I learned Python?\n4. If the third is true, will my productivity increases just by learning a language, again like when I learned Python?\n\nTo answer the questions, I will need to read more about Swift.\n\n---\n\nHere's what Apple thinks about Swift, taken from [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-XID_0).\n\n> Swift is a new programming language for iOS and OS X apps that builds on the best of C and Objective-C, without the constraints of C compatibility. Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun. \n\n> Swift’s clean slate, backed by the mature and much-loved Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, is an opportunity to reimagine how software development works.\n\nReading through the page, I'm noting below various code snippets I fell in love with instantly.\n\n---\n\n```\nlet apples = 3\nlet oranges = 5\nlet appleSummary = \"I have \\(apples) apples.\"\nlet fruitSummary = \"I have \\(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit.\"\n```\n\nSay good bye to the `@` literal in strings and say hello to smart String formatting.\n\n---\n\n```\nvar shoppingList = [\"catfish\", \"water\", \"tulips\", \"blue paint\"]\nshoppingList[1] = \"bottle of water\"\n \nvar occupations = [\n    \"Malcolm\": \"Captain\",\n    \"Kaylee\": \"Mechanic\",\n]\noccupations[\"Jayne\"] = \"Public Relations\"\n```\n\nWill need to get used using brackets `[]` for dictionaries.\n\n---\n\n```\nlet emptyDictionary = Dictionary<String, Float>()\n```\n\nYou see Java?

Yes.\n2. The language.\n3. Yes.\n4. Yes.\n\n### Vendor Lock In\n\nApple is innovating by copying yet again. I'm not saying this is bad, look at what they did before with Xerox and look at how they are right now. Hell, take a look at your iOS 7. They say imitation is the highest form of flattery but I argue that this ain't flattery at all.\n\nOver the course of Apple's remarkable history, Apple innovates by making better and great products with emphasis on UX and quality. The rest of the gang ended up mimicking what Apple innovated over and over. They invent things and profit.\n\nWhat's that gotta do with Vendor Lock in? Here are some more excerpts about the new tech Apple is showcasing last night.\n\n#### [Home Kit Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/HomeKit/Reference/HomeKit_Framework/index.html)\n\n> Home Kit provides seamless integration between accessories that support Apple's Home Automation Protocol and iOS devices, allowing for new advances in home automation. By promoting a common protocol for home automation devices and making a public API available for configuring and communicating with those devices, Home Kit makes possible a marketplace where the app a user controls their home with doesn’t have to be created by the vendor who made their home automation accessories, and where home automation accessories from multiple vendors can all be integrated into a single coherent whole without those vendors having to coordinate directly with each other.\n\nMe as an engineer loves the Homekit idea. I fell in love with mobile phones first but true love is with embedded systems. There are so many ARM development boards available as a platform of innovation. However, they lack standards. What Apple is offering is just stupid to say no to.\n\nAirplay is what I consider a prequel of Home Kit. It just **works**.\n\n#### [Carplay](http://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/)\n\n> [...] Just plug in your iPhone and go.\n\nYou see? Again it just works. \n\n#### Locked In\n\nYou don't have to be a rocket scientist to `*play`. Apply this to their development community and voila. A relatively easy way of bulding products with the high standards Apple is famous for.\n\n### The Language\n\nI don't like Objective-C, C, C++ or anything like the trio. Period.\n\n### Swift is (not) Python\n\nSwift is Swift of course. The expressive nature of Swift is what attracts me. \n\nI've always thought that programming language is just another language. It's a [means to an end](http://bango29.com/means-to-an-end/). But, the art of any language is the poetries. By being expressive I believe best practices, clean codes and design patterns are implemented as the highest importance.\n\n---\n\nSo, Swift reinvigorates my interest towards iOS and Apple in general. Here's something from Ice House HQ to further interest you in Swift.\n\n![Swift Craze](/content/images/2014/Jun/2x.jpg)","html":"<p>Incidentally, yesterday I reconverted myself as an iPhone user once again. Just in time for Apple WWDC. I thought I was gonne be one of those late buyers who'll regret what they just bought when not very long, a \"better\" phone/hardware introduced. On the contrary, this was my most \"on time\" purchase of an iPhone ever.</p>\n\n<p>These couple of years, I've limit myself from coding in iOS. I genuinely don't like Objective-C just like I don't like Ruby. My dislike doesn't mean I didn't try to at least a Hello World but each time I do it, it just reaffirms everything I don't like about Objective-C. No bashing is intended but I really think a top platform should have top tools.</p>\n\n<p>Take for example how well Microsoft treated their developer ecosystem by providing them with the best IDE I've tried so far: Visual Studio. I acknowledge that this is subjective but you should try building software with only Make files and a plain text editor. Visual Studio is expensive yes and I'm grateful for Bizspark.</p>\n\n<p>Last night when I was watching the WWDC keynote about Swift, it was like Deja Vu.

Now, after buying a Raspberry Pi, what I want came true. With some research and a weekend, I got it up and running perfect.\n\nWhat I have in my disposal for this to happen are:\n\n1. Cubieboard A10 with [Cubian](http://cubian.org) - [NAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage), [nginx](http://nginx.org), [CouchPotato](https://couchpota.to/), [Transmission](http://transmissionbt.com), [Headphones](https://github.com/rembo10/headphones) and [SickBeard](http://sickbeard.com/)\n2. Raspberry Pi B with [Raspbmc](www.raspbmc.com)\n3. USB Hard Drive - Attached to the Cubieboard\n4. [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org) Wifi Router - or any router you can manipulate DNS with\n5. Another Wifi Router - because the main router's coverage is spotty upstairs, Raspberry Pi is attached to this router\n6. TV with HDMI (obviously) - spare HDMI input for the Raspberry Pi\n\nCubieboard and Raspberry Pi are connected using LAN cables. I'm not too sure about the Wifi's signal strength.\n\n---\n\n## Installation & Configuration\n\nUsing the links I provided above, we can deep dive into installing each service into each components. I'm sharing the recipe to make all of them work well together.\n\n## Cubieboard\n\n1. Consider using an externally powered USB hard drive. Cubieboard (and Raspberry Pi) are sensitive to power consumption should it go beyond 2 Amps.\n2. I would recommend a 2 A power supply but 1 A will do.\n3. I installed Cubian to the NAND partition. I don't have a spare microSD card available.\n4. When all of the services are started, the 1 GB memory will run out quickly leaving only a few megabytes free. Make a swap file, like [here](http://www.bango29.com/cubieboard-part-1/#swapfile). Instead of creating at the external drive, I created the swap at the root of the NAND partition.\n\n## Raspberry Pi\n\n1. Consider using heatsinks to prevent overheating the chips if the device is to be ran 24/7.\n2. **MUST USE** at least a 1 Amp power supply.\n\n## Raspbmc\n\n1. After booting the first time, make sure it's set a static IP Address by using Raspbmc Config Program available conveniently at XBMC's *Programs*.\n2. I don't have a physical remote (and keyboard) to control XBMC. I did plug a mouse to it but that's just about it. I'm using the [Official XBMC app](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Official_XBMC_Remote/iOS) on my iPhone and [XBMC Constellation](https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/xbmc-constellation/id437807301?mt=8) on my iPad to control XBMC.\n\n## Cubian\n\n1. Mount the external USB Hard Drive and Swapfile at boot time. Add entries to `/etc/fstab`.\n2. Give it a static IP, modify `/etc/network/interfaces`.\n3. I encourage **NOT** to use `FAT32` partitions. It keeps unmounting. I would suggest to use `EXT4` for all partitions.\n\n### Samba\n\nSince we are using Samba to share the Hard Drive, it won't matter which filesystem is used for the USB External Hard Drive partitions. Might as well be native to Linux and release yourself of funky implementations.\n\nIn my case, I have 2 partitions mounted at `/media/EVO` and `/media/Linx`. Your mileage may vary. Here is my `smb.conf` as a template.\n\n```\n[global]\n   workgroup = Bango29\n   server string = %h server\n   dns proxy = no\n   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m\n   max log size = 1000\n   syslog = 0\n   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d\n   encrypt passwords = true\n   passdb backend = tdbsam\n   obey pam restrictions = yes\n   unix password sync = yes\n   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u\n   passwd chat = *Enter\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *Retype\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *password\\supdated\\ssuccessfully* .\n   pam password change = yes\n   map to guest = bad user\n   usershare allow guests = yes\n   security = user\n\n[EVO]\n   comment = Movies, TV Shows and more\n   path = /media/EVO\n   create mask = 0777\n   directory mask = 0777\n   read only = no\n   writable = yes\n   browsable = yes\n   guest ok = yes\n   guest account = cubie\n   guest only = yes\n   public = yes\n\n[Linx]\n   comment = More Movies, TV Shows and more\n   path = /media/Linx\n   create mask = 0777\n   directory mask = 0777\n   read only = no\n   writable = yes\n   browsable = yes\n   guest ok = yes\n   guest account = cubie\n   guest only = yes\n   public = yes\n```\n\nI set all of my shares to be available publicly, browsable and a `guest` user is enough.\n\n### Transmission\n\nWho doesn't love [Transmission](http://www.transmission-bt.com)? I would say subjectively, this is the best Torrent client I've used so far.\n\nSome will argue that [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/) is a more suiting and Pythonic choice. I didn't care. My simple reason will be because my wife is already familiar with Transmission.\n\n### CouchPotato\n\nI am relieved that such application exists. I would just put in any movie I'd want to download and CouchPotato will rigirously scour the internet. It can even determine if the found item is suited to my liking or not. It's very convenient to say the least.\n\nWhenever a match is found, it will make an API call to the Transmission daemon to download it if it's a torrent.\n\n**More Win**: It has integration with [Pushbullet](http://pushbullet.com). For any event, it will push something to my iPhone or my Chrome for notifications. Sweet!\n\n### SickBeard\n\nSame as CouchPotato, only this one is for TV Shows. Need I say more?\n\n### Headphones\n\nSame as SickBeard, only this one is for music. Need I say more?\n\n## DNS and nginx\n\nSo I wanted all the above services with a choosen subdomain that does not exists on the Internet. I only want it to exist locally. Praise The Lord for [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org) and [nginx](http://nginx.org).\n\nThe subdomains were:\n\n* movie.bango29.lan - CouchPotato\n* music.bango29.lan - Headphones\n* serial.bango29.lan - SickBeard\n* torrent.bango29.lan - Transmission Web GUI\n* tv.bango29.lan - Raspbmc\n\nHere is where the DNS magic happened on OpenWRT.\n\n![OpenWRT DNS Aliases](/content/images/2014/Aug/Screen-Shot-2014-08-17-at-2-03-55-AM.png)\n\nnginx is used to reverse proxy the subdomains above to specific local ports where the services are serving. A simple nginx config file can be like below.\n\n```\nserver {\n\tserver_name movie.bango29.lan;\n\tlisten 80;\n\tlisten 8080;\n\n\tlocation / {\n\t\tproxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5050/;\n\t}\n\n\tlocation ~ /\\.ht {\n\t\tdeny all;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nSo the above is the current setup for my Integrated Home Entertainment system. My next venture will be buying an HDMI audio multiplexer. Right now my 5.1 speaker system is only outputting in stereo. It'd be complete when it outputs in truly 5.1.\n\nSigning off with a picture of my Raspberry Pi after unboxing. USB TTL cable is a must have really. Makes everything a whole lot easier.\n\nCheers!\n\n![Raspberry Pi](/content/images/2014/Aug/rpi.jpg)","html":"<p>I've always wanted my own Home Entertainment solution before I bought my Cubieboard.

This blog post is a practical example of the topic with web development in Python and CI with Jenkins. A bit of [Test Driven Development (TDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is practiced. Ultimately it's the reader's choice to figure out what's right your themselves.\n\n## Why CI?\n\nThe idea is to create a process of which in practice builds foundation for software. A safety net to catch defects early is part of the side effect, localizing complex systems into micro parts and test them to ensure quality over time.\n\nIt's great for any pragmatists. Gives you a virtual sense of protection against bad & smelly codes.\n\n> It's tested or it's broken\n\nNo matter how good your tests are, you still can't outrun bad design decisions. \n\nTests are derived from design decisions. It's impossible to make it work perfect the first time, tests can be considered as battles. The more battles you won, the greater the chances of winning the war.\n\nJenkins is there to make sure codes will always work on vanilla environments out of the box. Yes configurations are necessary evils. A great hat tip is to keep configurations separate from codes.\n\n## Objectives\n\nWhat I wanna do is to extend both an idea and an implementation written by [Aria Rajasa](https://twitter.com/rajasa). He wrote a client to interface on an Online Banking frontend. It was necessary for him to check on it regularly without all the fuzz.\n\nThe codes are written in PHP. I decided to clone it and build a Python equivalent with CI and best practices in mind. As of this writing, it's still an ongoing effort.\n\nWhat the codes will do is to automatically retrieve the latest mutation history of your bank account. An HTML frontend will then display the results.\n\nIt was supposed to be a weekend project but I learned a thing or two on how to structure Flask projects more efficiently. Being a small and loose web framework, engineers can get lost with their separation of concerns.\n\nA lot of the implementations are inspired from Rails. I despise the language but I love the separation of concerns brought up by Rails. And _conventions over configurations_ is also neat.\n\n## Recipe\n\nThese are the building blocks for this project:\n\n- Python 2.7.x - [link](https://www.python.org/)\n- Flask 0.10 - [link](http://flask.pocoo.org)\n- Jenkins 1.580 - [link](http://jenkins-ci.org)\n- Git SCM - [link](http://git-scm.com)\n- Github - [link](https://github.com)\n- Glowing Octo Tyrion - [link](https://github.com/tistaharahap/glowing-octo-tyrion)\n\n## Git\n\nBefore anything else, `git` is the most important topic. My remotes always have these branches:\n\n- `develop`\n- `release`\n- `master`\n\nSome remotes does not have the `release` branch yet. The branch is only pushed if an actual release is ready.\n\n### Flow\n\nThe `develop` branch is where I merge different local (and remote if applicable) `feature/*` branches. A typical vanilla `git` repo will likely look like below.\n\n```bash\n$ git init\n$ vim README.md\n$ vim .gitignore\n$ git add README.md .gitignore\n$ git commit -m \"initial commit\" .\n$ git remote add origin git@github.com:tistaharahap/some_project.git\n$ git push origin master\n$ git checkout -b develop\n```\n\nAfter pushing the initial commit to the `master` branch, immediately switch to the `develop` branch. Then set up the basic structure of the project. After I am done, I switch to a `feature` branch to start working.\n\n```bash\n# Let's say that I wanna write some codes for the login feature\n$ git checkout -b feature/auth\n\n# When I'm done with the feature, I commit and merge it with develop branch\n$ git commit -m \"Add login feature\" .\n$ git checkout develop\n# Pull latest changes from remote first\n$ git pull origin develop\n# Merge with feature/auth\n$ git merge --no-ff feature/auth\n\n# Let's do another feature: user profile\n$ git checkout -b feature/user_profile\n# Done\n$ git commit -m \"add user profile controller\" .\n$ git checkout develop\n$ git pull origin develop\n$ git merge --no-ff feature/user_profile\n\n# Logout\n$ git checkout feature/auth\n# The last time I was here, things have been progressing\n$ git merge --no-ff develop\n# Do my thing and commit\n$ git commit -m \"add logout to auth\" .\n$ git checkout develop\n$ git pull origin develop\n$ git merge --no-ff feature/auth\n```\n\nAt the end of a sprint, I would want a `release` branch for QA to test what I've been working at.\n\n```bash\n# Sync local develop branch with remote\n$ git checkout develop\n$ git pull origin develop\n$ git checkout -b release\n$ git merge --no-ff develop\n$ git push origin develop\n$ git push origin release\n\n# QA says the logout feature is buggy\n$ git checkout feature/auth\n# Do my work and commit\n$ git commit -m \"fix buggy logout\" .\n# Checkout release and merge the changes\n$ git checkout release\n$ git pull origin release\n$ git merge --no-ff release\n```\n\nIf you see at the last 2 steps above, I checked out and merged to the `release` branch after QA's report of a buggy feature. As long as the QA process is going on, do not merge anything to `develop` that is not a part of that release cycle.\n\nWhen QA has given the go ahead, it's time to merge to the `master` branch.\n\n```bash\n# Sync local with remote master branch\n$ git checkout master\n$ git pull origin master\n\n# Merge release with master and tag a version\n$ git merge --no-ff release\n$ git tag v0.1.0\n$ git push --tags origin master\n\n# Merge back to develop branch\n$ git checkout develop\n$ git pull origin develop\n$ git merge --no-ff master\n```\n\nThis flow is inspired from [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). The `release` branch strategy is the only difference.\n\n## Flask\n\nFlask is a micro yet powerful web framework. It is definitely not for anyone who wants structure. Being micro, Flask does not try to solve all the problems of a web framework. It simply wants to be a micro framework and do it great.\n\nStructure is key to a successful Flask project. My weekend is spent setting up solid structures with tested codes.\n\n```\nglowing-octo-tyrion\n|__ app\n|__ __ config\n|__ __ controllers\n|__ __ errors\n|__ __ __ __init__.py\n|__ __ __ errors.py\n|__ __ helpers\n|__ __ services\n|__ __ __init__.py\n|__ static\n|__ __ coffee\n|__ __ css\n|__ __ js\n|__ __ out\n|__ templates\n|__ tests\n|__ __ helpers\n|__ __ __init__.py\n|__ __ base_test.py\n|__ .gitignore\n|__ README.md\n|__ deps\n|__ start\n```\n\nThe structure above is revolving that will eventually be a boilerplate.\n\n### Testing\n\nLet's take an example from the Glowing Octo Tyrion project.\n\nWe have 3 helpers: `app_helper.py`, `args_helper.py` and `yaml_helper.py`. The helpers is matched with these test classes: `app_helper_test.py`, `args_helper_test.py` and `yaml_helper_test.py`.\n\n```\n|__ app\n...\n|__ __ helpers\n|__ __ __ __init__.py\n|__ __ __ app_helper.py\n|__ __ __ args_helper.py\n|__ __ __ yaml_helper.py\n...\n|__ tests\n|__ __ helpers\n|__ __ __ __init__.py\n|__ __ __ app_helper_test.py\n|__ __ __ args_helper_test.py\n|__ __ __ yaml_helper_test.py\n...\n```\n\nLet's examine `yaml_helper.py` and `yaml_helper_test.py`.\n\n```python\n# yaml_helper.py\nfrom app.errors import ConfigNotFoundError\nimport yaml\nimport os.path\n\n\ndef read_yaml(filename):\n    if not os.path.isfile(filename):\n        raise ConfigNotFoundError('The file %s is not found' % filename)\n\n    doc = {}\n\n    with open(filename, 'r') as f:\n        doc = yaml.load(f)\n\n    return doc\n```\n\nI am a proponent of [Defensive Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming) and the error handling above is a reflection of it. Never trust parameters.\n\nIn Java a method signature is allowed to throw all kinds of exceptions, this is lacking in Python. We'd never know what kind of exceptions a method can throw. That's why the unit test should also reflect the exceptions as seen below.\n\n```python\n# yaml_helper_test.py\nfrom tests.base_test import BaseTest\nfrom app.helpers import read_yaml\nfrom nose.tools import raises, ok_\nfrom app.errors import ConfigNotFoundError\n\n\nclass YamlHelperTest(BaseTest):\n\n    def test_read_yaml(self):\n        path = 'app/config/config.yml'\n        config = read_yaml(path)\n\n        ok_(isinstance(config, dict),\n            msg='Returned object must be an instance of dict')\n        ok_(len(config.keys()) > 0,\n            msg='Returned object must not be empty')\n\n    @raises(ConfigNotFoundError)\n    def test_read_yaml_imaginary_file_should_raises_error(self):\n        path = '/a/b/s/c.yml'\n        config = read_yaml(path)\n```\n\nIf you see the test above, it is not as robust as I want it to be. Comparing the `yaml_helper.py` codes, there is still an untested line.\n\n```python\ndoc = yaml.load(f)\n```\n\nAfter looking into [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML)'s source code, the error handling mechanism does not raises any exception upon failing. This is why I can only do so much to test the codes.\n\nHowever my second test case `test_read_yaml_imaginary_file_should_raises_error` is already defining possible exceptions. In this case, only 1 exception. Just by reading the unit test, supposedly it can and will be the best documentation of an application.\n\n### Configuration\n\nRails prides itself being a [_convention over configuration_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) framework. Although the concept is nothing new, Rails brought the concept mainstream. Lending this concept to this project opened up some more niceties.\n\n#### Config Separated From Codes\n\nI love dictionaries, hash maps or anything else you'd want to call it as. Cognitive load becomes cheap. I choose to use [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) as the configuration files format. It has smart referencing for generic objects and libraries are available in any platform. Python has [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML) as mentioned before.\n\n```\n|__ app\n|__ config\n|__ __ config.yml.sample\n|__ __ routes.yml\n...\n```\n\nThe file `config.yml.sample` is no much different than what you'd find in any Rails installation. While the `routes.yml` is a convenience over Flask's verbose routing procedures when trying out Flask's getting started tutorial.\n\n```yaml\n# routes.yml\nhome:\n    uri: '/'\n    methods:\n        - GET\n    controller: home\n\nabout:\n    uri: '/about'\n    methods:\n        - GET\n    controller: about\n```\n\nLet's now examine the codes to make the routes applicable.\n\n```python\n# Excerpts from app/helpers/app_helper.py\ndef create_routes(app, app_routes=routes):\n    if not app_routes:\n        raise ConfigNotFoundError('Routes are empty')\n\n    for (k, v) in app_routes.iteritems():\n        route = app_routes[k]\n\n        try:\n            loaded_mod = load_class('app.controllers.%sController' % route['controller'].title())\n        except AttributeError:\n            raise ControllerNotFoundError('Class %sController is not found' % route['controller'].title())\n\n        clsmethods = dir(loaded_mod)\n        for method in route['methods']:\n            method = method.lower()\n            if method not in clsmethods:\n                raise HTTPMethodNotImplementedError('Class %sController is not implementing method %s' % (route['controller'].title(), method.upper()))\n\n        app.add_url_rule(route['uri'],\n                         view_func=loaded_mod.as_view('%s_controller' % route['controller']),\n                         methods=route['methods'])\n```\n\nThe codes above dynamically load proper controllers for each available endpoint read from `routes.yaml` and look for the controller in the `app/controller` directory. For each declared route, the configuration also registers applicable HTTP Methods. This is validated against the controller class and raises `HTTPMethodNotImplementedError ` if it's not satisfied.\n\nThis way we are actually enforcing a pattern to be followed upon creating/modifying any endpoints.\n\nAlso apparent, by keeping the configuration file in its own DSL, the application side (Python) of the project is prohibited to make direct modifications to its content. In other words, Cowboy moments are a thing of the past.\n\n### Frontend Static Assets\n\nWith a dynamic and less verbose routing mechanism, the next subject is to manage frontend static assets. For this project, I have a few static asset formats I want to compile, minify and not worry about versioning at all. This is where [Flask Assets](http://flask-assets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) came handy.\n\nFlask Assets is a wrapper around [Webassets](http://webassets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Here are the file types of my static assets:\n\n- CoffeeScript\n- JavaScript\n- CSS\n\nSpecifically to CoffeeScript, I don't want to execute another watcher each time I do my development. I want my app to be smart enough to see the changes and refresh accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Excerpts from app/helpers/app_helper.py\ndef compile_assets(app, controller_name):\n    if not isinstance(controller_name, str):\n        raise TypeError('The parameter controller_name must be an instance of String')\n    if len(controller_name) == 0:\n        raise ValueError('The parameter controller_name must have a length of more than 0')\n\n    assets = Environment(app)\n\n    coffee = compile_asset(controller_name=controller_name,\n                           asset_type=ASSET_TYPE_COFFEE)\n    css = compile_asset(controller_name=controller_name,\n                        asset_type=ASSET_TYPE_CSS)\n    js = compile_asset(controller_name=controller_name,\n                       asset_type=ASSET_TYPE_JS)\n\n    assets.register('coffee_all', coffee)\n    assets.register('css_all', css)\n    assets.register('js_all', js)\n```\n\nAs you can infer from the codes above, the static assets are managed when the routes are created. My own CoffeScript codes will be compiled to JavaScript. The JavaScript assets are third party libraries I'd need. CSS is still plain old CSS. However, should in the future I'd want to add support to [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), I can just add support for it.\n\n```python\n# Excerpts from app/helpers/app_helper.py\ndef compile_asset(controller_name, asset_type):\n    eligible_asset_types = [\n        ASSET_TYPE_CSS,\n        ASSET_TYPE_COFFEE,\n        ASSET_TYPE_JS\n    ]\n\n    if not isinstance(controller_name, str):\n        raise TypeError('The parameter controller_name must be an instance of String')\n    if len(controller_name) == 0:\n        raise ValueError('The parameter controller_name must have a length of more than 0')\n    if not isinstance(asset_type, str):\n        raise TypeError('The parameter controller_name must be an instance of String')\n    if len(asset_type) == 0:\n        raise ValueError('The parameter controller_name must have a length of more than 0')\n    if asset_type not in eligible_asset_types:\n        raise ValueError('The parameter asset_type is unknown')\n\n    asset_path = '%s/' % asset_type\n\n    static_abs_path = os.path.abspath('static')\n    bundle = ['%smain.%s' % (asset_path, asset_type)]\n\n    controller_asset_path = '%s/%s/%s.%s' % (static_abs_path, asset_type, controller_name, asset_type)\n    if os.path.isfile(controller_asset_path):\n        bundle.append('%s%s.%s' % (asset_path, controller_name, asset_type))\n\n    bundle_params = {\n        ASSET_TYPE_COFFEE: {\n            'filters': 'coffeescript,rjsmin',\n            'out': 'out/a.js'\n        },\n        ASSET_TYPE_CSS: {\n            'filters': 'cssmin',\n            'out': 'out/a.css'\n        },\n        ASSET_TYPE_JS: {\n            'filters': 'rjsmin',\n            'out': 'b.js'\n        }\n    }\n\n    asset = Bundle(*bundle,\n                   filters=bundle_params[asset_type]['filters'],\n                   output=bundle_params[asset_type]['out'])\n\n    return asset\n```\n\nThe codes above is lending concepts from Java and Rails. From Java, I enjoy having constants as values instead of just values. It's much more readable. While from Rails, the conventions within the codes are very apparent. We assume the assets are located in prescribed directories.\n\nNearing to the end of the codes before returning is something that is truly Pythonic.\n\n```python\nasset = Bundle(*bundle,\n               filters=bundle_params[asset_type]['filters'],\n               output=bundle_params[asset_type]['out'])\n```\n\nNotice that the `Bundle` constructor only accepts multiple unnamed arguments as its files bundle. With Python, I can just put the files into a `List` and prefix a `*` to the `bundle` variable. This means that the `Bundle` constructor should accept all of the list elements within the `bundle` variable as it parameters.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nWhat is the best way to really know about your application?\n\nYes certainly debatable. Personally, I feel the best answer for me is to know about all the errors that can and might happen within my application. By doing so, I enable myself a deeper understanding of the application and practice proper Defensive Programming.\n\nFor this reason, I have a special package called `errors`.\n\n```\n|__ app\n...\n|__ __ errors\n|__ __ __ __init__.py\n|__ __ __ errors.py\n...\n```\n\n```python\nclass GlowingOctoTyrionError(Exception): pass\n\nclass HTTPMethodNotImplementedError(GlowingOctoTyrionError): pass\n\nclass ControllerNotFoundError(GlowingOctoTyrionError): pass\n\nclass NoEnvSpecifiedError(GlowingOctoTyrionError): pass\n\nclass ConfigNotFoundError(GlowingOctoTyrionError): pass\n```\n\nErrors or Exceptions is preferrably as detailed as it can be. Grouping errors is ok but not generic errors as it defeats the purpose of error handling. For this, I borrow the concept from Java.\n\n## Jenkins\n\nJenkins is tightly related with the Git flow mentioned above. A matrix of how this relationship is formed is shown below.\n\n|            | develop | release | master |\n|------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| dev        |    X    |         |        |\n| staging    |         |    X    |        |\n| production |         |         |    X   |\n\nThe `X` axis defines the Git branches while the `Y` axis shows the environments of which the branches are applied to.\n\n### Plugins\n\nJenkins comes with an awesome plugins collection supported by a great community of engineers. For our purpose, we will need to have these plugins:\n\n- [Git](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin)\n- [Github](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+Plugin)\n- [ShiningPanda](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/ShiningPanda+Plugin)\n- [Cobertura](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin)\n\nMore about creating a project on Jenkins later.\n\n#### Git\n\nObviously the plugin is crucial to use Git. Other than this plugin, make sure you have Git properly installed on your server.\n\n```bash\n$ sudo apt-get install git\n```\n\n#### Github\n\nCreate a personal token and give it permissions to access your repos. Configure this within Jenkins `Configure System` menu.\n\n#### Shining Panda\n\nWith this plugin, we can localize our Python projects by using `virtualenv`. On every build, we can also choose to do a vanilla install of the project. Ideal to keep your projects running out of the box.\n\n### Setting Up a Job\n\nSince we're developing in Python, let's make sure that all the necessary dependencies are satisfied.\n\n```bash\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-pip\n$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip\n$ sudo pip install nose nosexcover\n```\n\nAssuming Jenkins is already up and running, let's try setting up a new Jenkins job for the `develop` branch.\n\n![New Jenkins Job](http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/newitem.png)\n\n![New Job Spec](http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-6-26-23-PM.png)\n\nWhen the dust settles, let's configure the job to suit our needs.\n\n![Configure Job](http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/configure.png)\n\nIf you haven't added Jenkins' public key to your SCM's `authorized_keys`, now's a good time.\n\n![Git Source Code](http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-6-54-05-PM.png)\n\n![Github Hook](http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-10-00-PM.png)\n\n![Virtualenv Builder](http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-13-31-PM.png)\n\n![Virtualenv Shell Script](http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-18-40-PM.png)\n\n![JUnit Report](http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-21-23-PM.png)\n\n![Cobertura Report](http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-25-18-PM.png)\n\n### Result\n\nAfter all that configuration, this is what becomes of it.\n\n![Result](http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-28-27-PM.png)\n\nFeel free to click on the links there. You will find all kinds of useful information about your codes and the unit test.\n\n#### Coverage\n\nCode coverage report is enabled by the Cobertura plugin. With this, you can get an overview of how well your unit testing codes are. This bit decides what kind of weather icons assigned to your job after every build.\n\n---\n\nFor this blog post, this is as far as it goes.

My remotes always have these branches:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>develop</code></li>\n<li><code>release</code></li>\n<li><code>master</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some remotes does not have the <code>release</code> branch yet. The branch is only pushed if an actual release is ready.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flow\">Flow</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>develop</code> branch is where I merge different local (and remote if applicable) <code>feature/*</code> branches. A typical vanilla <code>git</code> repo will likely look like below.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"bash\">$ git init\n$ vim README.md\n$ vim .gitignore\n$ git add README.md .gitignore\n$ git commit -m \"initial commit\" .\n$ git remote add origin git@github.com:tistaharahap/some_project.git\n$ git push origin master\n$ git checkout -b develop\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After pushing the initial commit to the <code>master</code> branch, immediately switch to the <code>develop</code> branch. Then set up the basic structure of the project. After I am done, I switch to a <code>feature</code> branch to start working.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"bash\"># Let's say that I wanna write some codes for the login feature\n$ git checkout -b feature/auth\n\n# When I'm done with the feature, I commit and merge it with develop branch\n$ git commit -m \"Add login feature\" .\n$ git checkout develop\n# Pull latest changes from remote first\n$ git pull origin develop\n# Merge with feature/auth\n$ git merge --no-ff feature/auth\n\n# Let's do another feature: user profile\n$ git checkout -b feature/user_profile\n# Done\n$ git commit -m \"add user profile controller\" .\n$ git checkout develop\n$ git pull origin develop\n$ git merge --no-ff feature/user_profile\n\n# Logout\n$ git checkout feature/auth\n# The last time I was here, things have been progressing\n$ git merge --no-ff develop\n# Do my thing and commit\n$ git commit -m \"add logout to auth\" .\n$ git checkout develop\n$ git pull origin develop\n$ git merge --no-ff feature/auth\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At the end of a sprint, I would want a <code>release</code> branch for QA to test what I've been working at.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"bash\"># Sync local develop branch with remote\n$ git checkout develop\n$ git pull origin develop\n$ git checkout -b release\n$ git merge --no-ff develop\n$ git push origin develop\n$ git push origin release\n\n# QA says the logout feature is buggy\n$ git checkout feature/auth\n# Do my work and commit\n$ git commit -m \"fix buggy logout\" .\n# Checkout release and merge the changes\n$ git checkout release\n$ git pull origin release\n$ git merge --no-ff release\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you see at the last 2 steps above, I checked out and merged to the <code>release</code> branch after QA's report of a buggy feature. As long as the QA process is going on, do not merge anything to <code>develop</code> that is not a part of that release cycle.</p>\n\n<p>When QA has given the go ahead, it's time to merge to the <code>master</code> branch.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"bash\"># Sync local with remote master branch\n$ git checkout master\n$ git pull origin master\n\n# Merge release with master and tag a version\n$ git merge --no-ff release\n$ git tag v0.1.0\n$ git push --tags origin master\n\n# Merge back to develop branch\n$ git checkout develop\n$ git pull origin develop\n$ git merge --no-ff master\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This flow is inspired from <a href=\"http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/\">here</a>. The <code>release</code> branch strategy is the only difference.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"flask\">Flask</h2>\n\n<p>Flask is a micro yet powerful web framework. It is definitely not for anyone who wants structure. Being micro, Flask does not try to solve all the problems of a web framework. It simply wants to be a micro framework and do it great.</p>\n\n<p>Structure is key to a successful Flask project. My weekend is spent setting up solid structures with tested codes.</p>\n\n<pre><code>glowing-octo-tyrion  \n|__ app\n|__ __ config\n|__ __ controllers\n|__ __ errors\n|__ __ __ __init__.py\n|__ __ __ errors.py\n|__ __ helpers\n|__ __ services\n|__ __ __init__.py\n|__ static\n|__ __ coffee\n|__ __ css\n|__ __ js\n|__ __ out\n|__ templates\n|__ tests\n|__ __ helpers\n|__ __ __init__.py\n|__ __ base_test.py\n|__ .gitignore\n|__ README.md\n|__ deps\n|__ start\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The structure above is revolving that will eventually be a boilerplate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"testing\">Testing</h3>\n\n<p>Let's take an example from the Glowing Octo Tyrion project.</p>\n\n<p>We have 3 helpers: <code>app_helper.py</code>, <code>args_helper.py</code> and <code>yaml_helper.py</code>. The helpers is matched with these test classes: <code>app_helper_test.py</code>, <code>args_helper_test.py</code> and <code>yaml_helper_test.py</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>|__ app\n...\n|__ __ helpers\n|__ __ __ __init__.py\n|__ __ __ app_helper.py\n|__ __ __ args_helper.py\n|__ __ __ yaml_helper.py\n...\n|__ tests\n|__ __ helpers\n|__ __ __ __init__.py\n|__ __ __ app_helper_test.py\n|__ __ __ args_helper_test.py\n|__ __ __ yaml_helper_test.py\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let's examine <code>yaml_helper.py</code> and <code>yaml_helper_test.py</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"python\"># yaml_helper.py\nfrom app.errors import ConfigNotFoundError  \nimport yaml  \nimport os.path\n\n\ndef read_yaml(filename):  \n    if not os.path.isfile(filename):\n        raise ConfigNotFoundError('The file %s is not found' % filename)\n\n    doc = {}\n\n    with open(filename, 'r') as f:\n        doc = yaml.load(f)\n\n    return doc\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am a proponent of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming\">Defensive Programming</a> and the error handling above is a reflection of it. Never trust parameters.</p>\n\n<p>In Java a method signature is allowed to throw all kinds of exceptions, this is lacking in Python. We'd never know what kind of exceptions a method can throw. That's why the unit test should also reflect the exceptions as seen below.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"python\"># yaml_helper_test.py\nfrom tests.base_test import BaseTest  \nfrom app.helpers import read_yaml  \nfrom nose.tools import raises, ok_  \nfrom app.errors import ConfigNotFoundError\n\n\nclass YamlHelperTest(BaseTest):\n\n    def test_read_yaml(self):\n        path = 'app/config/config.yml'\n        config = read_yaml(path)\n\n        ok_(isinstance(config, dict),\n            msg='Returned object must be an instance of dict')\n        ok_(len(config.keys()) &gt; 0,\n            msg='Returned object must not be empty')\n\n    @raises(ConfigNotFoundError)\n    def test_read_yaml_imaginary_file_should_raises_error(self):\n        path = '/a/b/s/c.yml'\n        config = read_yaml(path)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you see the test above, it is not as robust as I want it to be. Comparing the <code>yaml_helper.py</code> codes, there is still an untested line.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"python\">doc = yaml.load(f)  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After looking into <a href=\"http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML\">PyYAML</a>'s source code, the error handling mechanism does not raises any exception upon failing. This is why I can only do so much to test the codes.</p>\n\n<p>However my second test case <code>test_read_yaml_imaginary_file_should_raises_error</code> is already defining possible exceptions. In this case, only 1 exception. Just by reading the unit test, supposedly it can and will be the best documentation of an application.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"configuration\">Configuration</h3>\n\n<p>Rails prides itself being a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration\"><em>convention over configuration</em></a> framework. Although the concept is nothing new, Rails brought the concept mainstream. Lending this concept to this project opened up some more niceties.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"configseparatedfromcodes\">Config Separated From Codes</h4>\n\n<p>I love dictionaries, hash maps or anything else you'd want to call it as. Cognitive load becomes cheap. I choose to use <a href=\"http://www.yaml.org/\">YAML</a> as the configuration files format. It has smart referencing for generic objects and libraries are available in any platform. Python has <a href=\"http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML\">PyYAML</a> as mentioned before.</p>\n\n<pre><code>|__ app\n|__ config\n|__ __ config.yml.sample\n|__ __ routes.yml\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The file <code>config.yml.sample</code> is no much different than what you'd find in any Rails installation. While the <code>routes.yml</code> is a convenience over Flask's verbose routing procedures when trying out Flask's getting started tutorial.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"yaml\"># routes.yml\nhome:  \n    uri: '/'\n    methods:\n        - GET\n    controller: home\n\nabout:  \n    uri: '/about'\n    methods:\n        - GET\n    controller: about\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let's now examine the codes to make the routes applicable.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"python\"># Excerpts from app/helpers/app_helper.py\ndef create_routes(app, app_routes=routes):  \n    if not app_routes:\n        raise ConfigNotFoundError('Routes are empty')\n\n    for (k, v) in app_routes.iteritems():\n        route = app_routes[k]\n\n        try:\n            loaded_mod = load_class('app.controllers.%sController' % route['controller'].title())\n        except AttributeError:\n            raise ControllerNotFoundError('Class %sController is not found' % route['controller'].title())\n\n        clsmethods = dir(loaded_mod)\n        for method in route['methods']:\n            method = method.lower()\n            if method not in clsmethods:\n                raise HTTPMethodNotImplementedError('Class %sController is not implementing method %s' % (route['controller'].title(), method.upper()))\n\n        app.add_url_rule(route['uri'],\n                         view_func=loaded_mod.as_view('%s_controller' % route['controller']),\n                         methods=route['methods'])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The codes above dynamically load proper controllers for each available endpoint read from <code>routes.yaml</code> and look for the controller in the <code>app/controller</code> directory. For each declared route, the configuration also registers applicable HTTP Methods. This is validated against the controller class and raises <code>HTTPMethodNotImplementedError</code> if it's not satisfied.</p>\n\n<p>This way we are actually enforcing a pattern to be followed upon creating/modifying any endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>Also apparent, by keeping the configuration file in its own DSL, the application side (Python) of the project is prohibited to make direct modifications to its content. In other words, Cowboy moments are a thing of the past.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"frontendstaticassets\">Frontend Static Assets</h3>\n\n<p>With a dynamic and less verbose routing mechanism, the next subject is to manage frontend static assets. For this project, I have a few static asset formats I want to compile, minify and not worry about versioning at all. This is where <a href=\"http://flask-assets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\">Flask Assets</a> came handy.</p>\n\n<p>Flask Assets is a wrapper around <a href=\"http://webassets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\">Webassets</a>. Here are the file types of my static assets:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>CoffeeScript</li>\n<li>JavaScript</li>\n<li>CSS</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Specifically to CoffeeScript, I don't want to execute another watcher each time I do my development. I want my app to be smart enough to see the changes and refresh accordingly.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"python\"># Excerpts from app/helpers/app_helper.py\ndef compile_assets(app, controller_name):  \n    if not isinstance(controller_name, str):\n        raise TypeError('The parameter controller_name must be an instance of String')\n    if len(controller_name) == 0:\n        raise ValueError('The parameter controller_name must have a length of more than 0')\n\n    assets = Environment(app)\n\n    coffee = compile_asset(controller_name=controller_name,\n                           asset_type=ASSET_TYPE_COFFEE)\n    css = compile_asset(controller_name=controller_name,\n                        asset_type=ASSET_TYPE_CSS)\n    js = compile_asset(controller_name=controller_name,\n                       asset_type=ASSET_TYPE_JS)\n\n    assets.register('coffee_all', coffee)\n    assets.register('css_all', css)\n    assets.register('js_all', js)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can infer from the codes above, the static assets are managed when the routes are created. My own CoffeScript codes will be compiled to JavaScript. The JavaScript assets are third party libraries I'd need. CSS is still plain old CSS. However, should in the future I'd want to add support to <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">LESS</a>, I can just add support for it.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"python\"># Excerpts from app/helpers/app_helper.py\ndef compile_asset(controller_name, asset_type):  \n    eligible_asset_types = [\n        ASSET_TYPE_CSS,\n        ASSET_TYPE_COFFEE,\n        ASSET_TYPE_JS\n    ]\n\n    if not isinstance(controller_name, str):\n        raise TypeError('The parameter controller_name must be an instance of String')\n    if len(controller_name) == 0:\n        raise ValueError('The parameter controller_name must have a length of more than 0')\n    if not isinstance(asset_type, str):\n        raise TypeError('The parameter controller_name must be an instance of String')\n    if len(asset_type) == 0:\n        raise ValueError('The parameter controller_name must have a length of more than 0')\n    if asset_type not in eligible_asset_types:\n        raise ValueError('The parameter asset_type is unknown')\n\n    asset_path = '%s/' % asset_type\n\n    static_abs_path = os.path.abspath('static')\n    bundle = ['%smain.%s' % (asset_path, asset_type)]\n\n    controller_asset_path = '%s/%s/%s.%s' % (static_abs_path, asset_type, controller_name, asset_type)\n    if os.path.isfile(controller_asset_path):\n        bundle.append('%s%s.%s' % (asset_path, controller_name, asset_type))\n\n    bundle_params = {\n        ASSET_TYPE_COFFEE: {\n            'filters': 'coffeescript,rjsmin',\n            'out': 'out/a.js'\n        },\n        ASSET_TYPE_CSS: {\n            'filters': 'cssmin',\n            'out': 'out/a.css'\n        },\n        ASSET_TYPE_JS: {\n            'filters': 'rjsmin',\n            'out': 'b.js'\n        }\n    }\n\n    asset = Bundle(*bundle,\n                   filters=bundle_params[asset_type]['filters'],\n                   output=bundle_params[asset_type]['out'])\n\n    return asset\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The codes above is lending concepts from Java and Rails. From Java, I enjoy having constants as values instead of just values. It's much more readable. While from Rails, the conventions within the codes are very apparent. We assume the assets are located in prescribed directories.</p>\n\n<p>Nearing to the end of the codes before returning is something that is truly Pythonic.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"python\">asset = Bundle(*bundle,  \n               filters=bundle_params[asset_type]['filters'],\n               output=bundle_params[asset_type]['out'])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice that the <code>Bundle</code> constructor only accepts multiple unnamed arguments as its files bundle. With Python, I can just put the files into a <code>List</code> and prefix a <code>*</code> to the <code>bundle</code> variable. This means that the <code>Bundle</code> constructor should accept all of the list elements within the <code>bundle</code> variable as it parameters.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"errorhandling\">Error Handling</h3>\n\n<p>What is the best way to really know about your application?</p>\n\n<p>Yes certainly debatable. Personally, I feel the best answer for me is to know about all the errors that can and might happen within my application. By doing so, I enable myself a deeper understanding of the application and practice proper Defensive Programming.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, I have a special package called <code>errors</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>|__ app\n...\n|__ __ errors\n|__ __ __ __init__.py\n|__ __ __ errors.py\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code class=\"python\">class GlowingOctoTyrionError(Exception): pass\n\nclass HTTPMethodNotImplementedError(GlowingOctoTyrionError): pass\n\nclass ControllerNotFoundError(GlowingOctoTyrionError): pass\n\nclass NoEnvSpecifiedError(GlowingOctoTyrionError): pass\n\nclass ConfigNotFoundError(GlowingOctoTyrionError): pass  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Errors or Exceptions is preferrably as detailed as it can be. Grouping errors is ok but not generic errors as it defeats the purpose of error handling. For this, I borrow the concept from Java.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"jenkins\">Jenkins</h2>\n\n<p>Jenkins is tightly related with the Git flow mentioned above. A matrix of how this relationship is formed is shown below.</p>\n\n<p>|            | develop | release | master |\n|------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| dev        |    X    |         |        |\n| staging    |         |    X    |        |\n| production |         |         |    X   |</p>\n\n<p>The <code>X</code> axis defines the Git branches while the <code>Y</code> axis shows the environments of which the branches are applied to.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"plugins\">Plugins</h3>\n\n<p>Jenkins comes with an awesome plugins collection supported by a great community of engineers. For our purpose, we will need to have these plugins:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin\">Git</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+Plugin\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/ShiningPanda+Plugin\">ShiningPanda</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin\">Cobertura</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More about creating a project on Jenkins later.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"git\">Git</h4>\n\n<p>Obviously the plugin is crucial to use Git. Other than this plugin, make sure you have Git properly installed on your server.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"bash\">$ sudo apt-get install git\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"github\">Github</h4>\n\n<p>Create a personal token and give it permissions to access your repos. Configure this within Jenkins <code>Configure System</code> menu.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"shiningpanda\">Shining Panda</h4>\n\n<p>With this plugin, we can localize our Python projects by using <code>virtualenv</code>. On every build, we can also choose to do a vanilla install of the project. Ideal to keep your projects running out of the box.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"settingupajob\">Setting Up a Job</h3>\n\n<p>Since we're developing in Python, let's make sure that all the necessary dependencies are satisfied.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"bash\">$ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-pip\n$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip\n$ sudo pip install nose nosexcover\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Assuming Jenkins is already up and running, let's try setting up a new Jenkins job for the <code>develop</code> branch.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/newitem.png\" alt=\"New Jenkins Job\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-6-26-23-PM.png\" alt=\"New Job Spec\" /></p>\n\n<p>When the dust settles, let's configure the job to suit our needs.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/configure.png\" alt=\"Configure Job\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you haven't added Jenkins' public key to your SCM's <code>authorized_keys</code>, now's a good time.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-6-54-05-PM.png\" alt=\"Git Source Code\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-10-00-PM.png\" alt=\"Github Hook\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-13-31-PM.png\" alt=\"Virtualenv Builder\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-18-40-PM.png\" alt=\"Virtualenv Shell Script\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-21-23-PM.png\" alt=\"JUnit Report\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-25-18-PM.png\" alt=\"Cobertura Report\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"result\">Result</h3>\n\n<p>After all that configuration, this is what becomes of it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bango29.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Screen-Shot-2014-09-22-at-7-28-27-PM.png\" alt=\"Result\" /></p>\n\n<p>Feel free to click on the links there.

I got the router running [OpenWRT](http://openwrt.org) thinking that it will perform better than the original firmware. It didn't.\n\n## Mikrotik FTW\n\nMy initial reaction was to get a new router. This time get a more powerful one with an added bonus of more Wifi speed. I thought of an [802.11AC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac) router. The ridiculous price of the routers turned me off. For IDR 2 millions, it's not worth it at all. Might as well get another [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) to play with.\n\nEarly this week while trying out [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), I went to Ratu Plaza. Yes I know the prices over there is too much but for a free ride on Uber, I was willing.\n\nI went into this store that is almost closing and noticed there's a Mikrotik RB750 on display. They're selling it at IDR 495.000. With out hesitation, I bought the router.\n\nI know nothing about Mikrotik other than it's the router most of my friends is networks & infrastructures usually opted for. So I studied it. Got [Winbox](http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Winbox) running on my Mac and logged in.\n\n![Winbox](/content/images/2014/Oct/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-2-04-42-AM.png)\n\nSeeing the menu on the left, I was like a boy lighting up for Christmas. Now this is a proper router. The only thing I don't like from it is that it's not a gigabit router.\n\nMy Wifi is being used by me, my wife and a bunch of other people who are my cousins next door. Since we're separated by walls, I might as well limit their traffic. It's often that when me or my wife wants to download or stream something, we got slow speeds.\n\nSlow speeds is not affected only by limited bandwidth, the router itself must be good enough to handle more open TCP connections. Especially if the users are big on torrents. Mikrotik gave **VERY STABLE** pings.\n\nJust replacing the old router with a Mikrotik increases the responsiveness of the network.

Therefore, a static hostname linked to a dynamic IP is a must.\n\nTried several Mikrotik dynamic dns scripts. But, to register to those dynamic dns providers is too much for me. I have Cloudflare to do my DNS, why not use that?\n\n### Cloudflare Client API\n\nOddly enough [the API](https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html) is not RESTful. All requests are `POST` requests. The part that I'm interested are `rec_load_all` and `rec_edit`.\n\nFirst you'd need to determine a hostname. For this purpose let's add `flare.bango29.com`.\n\n![Flare](/content/images/2014/Oct/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-11-58-11-AM.png)\n\nI put `127.0.0.1` just to test if later the mechanism worked.\n\nNow Mikrotik although great, can't do `HTTP` `POST` requests. A shame right? Nevertheless I'm not known to give up too easily.\n\n","html":"<p>Last week, I noticed that my home router a <a href=\"http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/?model=TL-WR941ND\">TP Link TP-WR941ND</a> is choking up pretty often handling ~10 average clients. I got the router running <a href=\"http://openwrt.org\">OpenWRT</a> thinking that it will perform better than the original firmware. It didn't.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mikrotikftw\">Mikrotik FTW</h2>\n\n<p>My initial reaction was to get a new router. This time get a more powerful one with an added bonus of more Wifi speed. I thought of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac\">802.11AC</a> router. The ridiculous price of the routers turned me off. For IDR 2 millions, it's not worth it at all. Might as well get another <a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/\">Raspberry Pi</a> to play with.</p>\n\n<p>Early this week while trying out <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/\">Uber</a>, I went to Ratu Plaza. Yes I know the prices over there is too much but for a free ride on Uber, I was willing.</p>\n\n<p>I went into this store that is almost closing and noticed there's a Mikrotik RB750 on display. They're selling it at IDR 495.000. With out hesitation, I bought the router.</p>\n\n<p>I know nothing about Mikrotik other than it's the router most of my friends is networks &amp; infrastructures usually opted for. So I studied it. Got <a href=\"http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Winbox\">Winbox</a> running on my Mac and logged in.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Oct/Screen-Shot-2014-10-11-at-2-04-42-AM.png\" alt=\"Winbox\" /></p>\n\n<p>Seeing the menu on the left, I was like a boy lighting up for Christmas. Now this is a proper router. The only thing I don't like from it is that it's not a gigabit router.</p>\n\n<p>My Wifi is being used by me, my wife and a bunch of other people who are my cousins next door. Since we're separated by walls, I might as well limit their traffic. It's often that when me or my wife wants to download or stream something, we got slow speeds.</p>\n\n<p>Slow speeds is not affected only by limited bandwidth, the router itself must be good enough to handle more open TCP connections. Especially if the users are big on torrents. Mikrotik gave <strong>VERY STABLE</strong> pings.</p>\n\n<p>Just replacing the old router with a Mikrotik increases the responsiveness of the network.

It's part of my identity. However, more often than not, I enjoyed the tech part more than the product itself. The temptation of any technical founders.\n\nI have a confession to make:\n\n> I hate writing code but I hate not writing code more.\n\nAs an engineer, naturally you'll always try to find new ways to solve, enhance and or upgrade the tech part. Admit it.\n\nNow with [this startup](https://bango29.com/do/) I'm now building, this is not good. It's an engineering company from the beginning, not a programming company. I think doing _just enough_ is very artistic. It shows depth of knowledge in just a fraction of the cost and time.\n\nTo pull it off, I think the people in the team matters more than the skills they individually have. Software Engineering and Products are something anyone can do with the right amount of willpower. It's hard to get the right people but it's even harder if there's a wrong hire, the complexity point is 13 out of 8.\n\n### Small is BIG\n\nI really feel that to think & execute big things, it must come from something small, and winning them. A good exercise for anyone's confidence level.\n\nNowadays, Software Engineering is getting way smarter with the revolution of tools and methodologies. What was before a process infused with dependencies along its lifecycle, now is getting decoupled more than ever.\n\nWith that in mind, a big team is not necessarily a high velocity team. We've come to upgrade our understanding of time into complexity points. In a sense, how we develop software right now is getting more personalized and humane.\n\n### Ideas & Execution\n\nThe beginning of any product is the designing of it. They are:\n\n* Product Design\n* Technical Design\n* Business Design\n\nIn that order preferrably.\n\nBut before all that happens, it starts with a small idea that got stuck in your head. Next is validating it. Let's assume that all the assumptions are validated, so why don't everyone else is not executing your idea?\n\nI stress that even though you think you have all the answers, all the work are still assumptions until proven otherwise by the user. I like that in [Lean Canvas](https://leanstack.com), one of the required work are experiments. We are always seeking to prove a point (or not) in all of the experiments.\n\nThe 7 Questions from [Peter Thiel's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) [0 To 1 book ](http://books.google.co.id/books/about/Zero_to_One.html) sums it all.\n\nWhat makes an idea distinguishes itself from the others? I think it's the execution. If there's an absolute truth in the Internet business is that the incumbent status is never permanent.\n\nHowever, these days the incumbents are disproving the previous sentence every single day. What's different?\n\n### Hunger\n\nOn the book [How Google Works](http://www.howgoogleworks.net/), [Eric Schmidt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt) pointed out that technical insights are key building blocks for a smart creatives to build upon. They've successfully and also failed to launch products that stemmed from it. However, they always thought of failures as a needed lesson for progress.\n\nAs an engineer, I can relate to the whole book, I am not a stranger to its ideas. That book talks about culture and hiring on its earliest chapters. I believe the same thing, I truly believe that to build businesses, the culture shapes the people and the people enforces the culture. A never ending cycle of improvements.\n\nWhen I meet with ex-colleagues from Urbanesia, I listen to them talking about 1 common theme. They tell me that they feel like a stranger in whichever companies they're working at the moment. They are so used to being empowered that they just hate being just a tool or a mean to an end.\n\nThey are people who are just too smart and too creative to only just be doers. I'm very proud of them but above all, I am happy that they persisted the culture way after we have gone our separate ways. They stick to the belief that culture and people are what drive products forward.\n\nWhen they can't find a supporting environment for them to excel, they feel like they are boxed in into a suffocating dilemma. That's a problem I hear about happening in many startups and companies in Indonesia. It's what's crippling the startup ecosystem generally.\n\nSo if you're a founder, let me ask you this:\n\n**Have you empowered your employees enough?**\n\nWhen you instill trust and delegation to smart creatives, they will come to you with their ideas. They will build products that are as big as their sense of belonging.\n\nBut I don't think that's enough. Look at Urbanesia, it's going nowhere now. For that reason, I reflect on these mistakes when I think of products:\n\n1. Vision\n2. Energy\n3. Emotion\n4. Stakeholders\n5. Focus\n\nOut of the 5, I am more careful with point 1 & 5.\n\n### Vision\n\n[Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html) came up with this quote:\n\n> Live in the future, then build what's missing.\n\nAs founders, we live in the future, constantly. It's not for everyone. How the hell do you live in the future?\n\nMy simple answer is: question your existence. It's fascinating that there are only 2 constants in the history of humans which are Ideas and Technology. I've been watching [Mankind: The Story of All of Us](http://www.history.com/shows/mankind-the-story-of-all-of-us) for the last month. I was questioning why humans need to exist from the first place.\n\nIt's only by fractions of fractions of a second when the universe exploded that life on earth is sustainable. The odds are stacked so high against us existing that it's incomprehensible. We are just so tiny when you look at it from the scale of the universe.\n\nOnly by questioning everything around me initially I expanded my mind to know more about the physics of the universe all the way to today. ==Asking the right question is an art==. When in doubt, I always question why am I even thinking it.\n\nBottomline, to live in the future, it must start with questions about the past and the present. The past is so important because even though civilization has progressed so much but as I said before, there are only 2 constants.\n\n### Focus\n\nIt's hard, really it's not easy. How do you focus on building for the future when the present is blocking? Questions like \"I don't even have enough to get by\" or \"How will this affect my family\" keeps on popping out. What if you change the questions to:\n\n> What will happen if you don't try?\n\nI always have a 5 years plan. Most of the decisions I did always revolves around my 5 years plan. How do I get there sooner? Because of this, the deciding part gets as binary as it can be. Boolean truth makes sense.\n\nWhy 5 years you asked? I think 5 years is not too far or too close to the future that you can shift directions (if needed) without having to sacrifice the destination. This has helped me focus my efforts with a single minded approach.\n\nAs do with any Agile executions, break down the goal into more manageable pieces with lower complexity points. Small wins are always better than loosing.\n\n### The Bar\n\nAs a first-born, I usually get what I want sooner or later. The instinct to just do it and make an example of myself to my brothers is so strong that it drives me forward all the time.\n\nI was the first one to get scolded coming home late in the night. This built an appetite/tolerance for risk.\n\nAbove all else, I set the bar. When I first joined Urbanesia, I immediately code alongside the other engineers. I stayed late and played guitar with the others. The only purpose is to show the others my persistence.\n\nAlong the way persistence turns into respect and respect turns into support. It took 1.5 years to gain the support but it was all worth it. Why did it took so long? Because all the efforts need to convert into results first.\n\nIn the end of the day, smart creatives are by default kind-hearted. My approach back then was totally unscalable but it will and has stuck with them for as long as they can remember. Now the people has a benchmark. The only thing interesting for them is to best it, nothing less.\n\n### Culture\n\nThis is the last part for this blog post. I am Indonesian and here there are 2 important defining traits for any Indoensian: Role Models and Relationships.\n\nOnce the bar is set, it's all about relationship. I find the most effective way to nurture it is to share knowledge. By knowledge I mean making \"Think Big\" as a source of empowerment.\n\nIf you're a business leader or an employee and you feel that sharing knowledge is dangerous, you might want to recheck yourself on the topic. People don't get to be smart creatives by controlling them with fear or lack of information. Instead I feel we must flood them with knowledge.\n\nOf course the term \"flood\" is overly unneeded. A more conservative term would be \"give\". I said it before that smart creatives are by default kind-hearted, how else are you gonna keep them around and joyful without giving?\n\nIn the office, I never liked having my own office or workspace. I like to be in the middle of the chaos. Not to add more to the chaos, I wanna be there to let the surrounding know that it's ok to be chaotic. I also like to approach someone to their desk rather than talking through a digital medium. It's the small things that matter that'll eventually become the best investment.\n\nThe only time I don't wanna be disturbed is when I put my thinking cap on. That means that I'm focusing on something, fuck off. One of my colleague at Icehouse even put an office hour sticky notes on top of his workspace so people know when to reach him.\n\nEven though we're in the digital space, we're still humans. We feed from each other's energy.\n\n---\n\nIn closing, the writings here is too good to be true. It's like for every `x` there's a `y`. No way, linear regressions only happens in Math. There's no such thing as an equilibrium in life. Something will always outweigh something else.\n\nPlease take all this with a pinch of salt. Squeeze some lemon juice, have a shot of tequilla to go with it.\n\nThis is an act of sharing, right now there are just so much trust in Indonesia, we just can't fuck it up. Be very careful because when you fuck it up, the whole industry suffers!","html":"<p>Since as long as I can remember, I've always enjoy building tech. It's part of my identity.

The conversations started with the usual \"How are you\"s but being geeks it led to various talks about tech. One of it was me telling everyone about [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).\n\nOne of the reactions about Docker was *why am I willing to complicate myself when the scale isn't there yet?* A valid argument.\n\nWhen I read about the Docker, the first thing that caught my attention is the tagline: **Build, Ship, and Run** - *An open platform for distributed applications for developers and sysadmins*. Developers and Sysadmins?\n\nAfter finishing a few more readings about Docker, I came across to [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/). It's a Linux distro that doesn't have any package manager at all. WTF right? As it turns out, Docker is its package manager. Apps are ran in containers, no clutter to the main OS. It really hit me.\n\n## Laptop To Production\n\nOften times, software engineers don't give the slightest care about environments other than their own laptop. This usually leads to complexity for the sysadmins. Ex: *it's working fine on my laptop, why isn't it working as expected on the production environment?*\n\nThe symptom above can be avoided by foolproofing configs, matching the OS on the production with the laptop, making sure all the dependencies are the exact version, etc. This is hard work! Even the slightest discrepancy can be responsible for intermittent defects within the software.\n\nThis is where Docker shows its most valuable power: **Consistency**.\n\nA few lines of `Dockerfile` is enough to gift you good night sleeps. How you ask? The long explanation is well written [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/docker-explained-using-dockerfiles-to-automate-building-of-images) at DigitalOcean. Get it?\n\nIf I have to be explicit then here goes. Docker uses a layered file system called [Union File System](https://docs.docker.com/engine/introduction/understanding-docker/#union-file-systems). So each time there's a change to the filesystem, it gets layered into the filesystem which then enable a versioning-like capability on the filesystem level.\n\nGetting back to the `Dockerfile`, it basically tells Docker that the base image for this container is let's say `ubuntu:latest`, update the `apt` & install these packages, get all the dependecies for my app and run it. That's it.\n\nOf course you can do more by [linking containers together](http://rominirani.com/2015/07/31/docker-tutorial-series-part-8-linking-containers/). Pretty powerful to share config values between containers.\n\nDocker enables simple orchestration with a relatively simple from concept to implementation. Best of all, you get consistency between your laptop to the production environment.\n\n## Source Code Changes\n\nBeing a Pythonista, I enjoy simple solutions for complex and even complicated problems. Updating source code is one of them.\n\nWith Docker you worry more about writing code and or managing the infrastructure than the small things that hurts you a lot. WTF? When your source code include a `Dockerfile`, you can be sure that an update means it's just `$ docker build .` away. Docker comes with [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).\n\nYou can commit changes to Docker Hub which will then can either act as a repo for your changes or get your Continous Delivery mechanism going with Automated Builds. I won't discuss the details since the road to hell is paved with good intentions. On a high level, Docker Hub is like Github powered by Jenkins.\n\n## Scale\n\nDocker comes with [Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/).\n\n> Docker Swarm is native clustering for Docker. It allows you create and access to a pool of Docker hosts using the full suite of Docker tools. Because Docker Swarm serves the standard Docker API, any tool that already communicates with a Docker daemon can use Swarm to transparently scale to multiple hosts.\n\nBasically you can combine multiple docker daemons running on different machines to form a single cluster. You can even [span multiple data centers](http://blog.weave.works/2014/10/08/i-just-created-a-cassandra-cluster-that-spans-3-different-network-domains-by-using-2-simple-shell-commands-how-cool-is-that/) with just a few lines of shell commands.\n\nI haven't scaled Docker to this order of magnitude but when I do need to, I'm comfortable that Docker manages to keep its abstraction as simple as possible.\n\n## Network Separation\n\nEvery container you run will run on a different network from its host. You can instead use a bridge to run it on the same network of course. But I think by running it of a different network by default gives an extra layer of complexity in the event that an attacker compromises your application.\n\nI run Docker on Digital Ocean, I miss AWS' VPC but I get it for free with Docker (sort of).\n\nThe only thing you expose to the public is the API container. Other than that, it stays private.\n\n---\n\nThe 4 points above are what drives me to implement Docker from early with Coral. Using Docker is like stacking Legos. It keeps your way of thinking simple. I've always liked complexity more than complication, Docker is exactly it.\n\nAs a footnote, I haven't written in a while and it's great to write about something disruptive. If you like what you're reading, there are plenty more of this on [Coral](http://www.coralshop.co.id), hit me up on `tista _%at%_ coral-inc.com` to have a conversation.","html":"<p>Last week, I went for the ocassional time a geek gets to down a few bottles of beer with other geeks. The conversations started with the usual \"How are you\"s but being geeks it led to various talks about tech. One of it was me telling everyone about <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One of the reactions about Docker was <em>why am I willing to complicate myself when the scale isn't there yet?</em> A valid argument.</p>\n\n<p>When I read about the Docker, the first thing that caught my attention is the tagline: <strong>Build, Ship, and Run</strong> - <em>An open platform for distributed applications for developers and sysadmins</em>. Developers and Sysadmins?</p>\n\n<p>After finishing a few more readings about Docker, I came across to <a href=\"https://coreos.com/\">CoreOS</a>. It's a Linux distro that doesn't have any package manager at all. WTF right? As it turns out, Docker is its package manager. Apps are ran in containers, no clutter to the main OS. It really hit me.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laptoptoproduction\">Laptop To Production</h2>\n\n<p>Often times, software engineers don't give the slightest care about environments other than their own laptop. This usually leads to complexity for the sysadmins. Ex: <em>it's working fine on my laptop, why isn't it working as expected on the production environment?</em></p>\n\n<p>The symptom above can be avoided by foolproofing configs, matching the OS on the production with the laptop, making sure all the dependencies are the exact version, etc. This is hard work! Even the slightest discrepancy can be responsible for intermittent defects within the software.</p>\n\n<p>This is where Docker shows its most valuable power: <strong>Consistency</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>A few lines of <code>Dockerfile</code> is enough to gift you good night sleeps. How you ask? The long explanation is well written <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/docker-explained-using-dockerfiles-to-automate-building-of-images\">here</a> at DigitalOcean. Get it?</p>\n\n<p>If I have to be explicit then here goes. Docker uses a layered file system called <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/introduction/understanding-docker/#union-file-systems\">Union File System</a>. So each time there's a change to the filesystem, it gets layered into the filesystem which then enable a versioning-like capability on the filesystem level.</p>\n\n<p>Getting back to the <code>Dockerfile</code>, it basically tells Docker that the base image for this container is let's say <code>ubuntu:latest</code>, update the <code>apt</code> &amp; install these packages, get all the dependecies for my app and run it. That's it.</p>\n\n<p>Of course you can do more by <a href=\"http://rominirani.com/2015/07/31/docker-tutorial-series-part-8-linking-containers/\">linking containers together</a>.
